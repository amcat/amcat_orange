"This stuff is thick but I warm it up in my hands and use it on my face when I'm at home during the day (and olive oil at night after I wash my face.) This keeps me looking young and to prevent wrinkles. Also the shea butter is very nice on my whole body, only problem is that it doesn't last very long. Still though, I got many compliments on how soft my skin was. If you use it after shaving it'll hydrate really well."	"Feels Amazing"	"good"
"The wand is quite large, so I had to be careful that I only applied it to my lashes and not my lids.  My lashes did appear fuller and prettier. However, after a few hours, I had raccoon eyes. It ran way too easily and hence caused a bit of itching and irritation."	"Nice mascara but it rubbed off way too easily."	"neutral"
"I didn't read all the reviews before I tried the product simply because I just really wanted to like this product.  I am a normal to dry skin person, with brownish-tan skin and yellow undertones.  The color of this product does not match my skin tone.  It is meant mainly for people who have very light, white, porcelainish skin tone.  Also, if you have oily face, this will matte the oilyness on your face making it look less shiny.  If you do not have oily skin, like i didn't, it made my face look a little more oily and shiny than usual.  Also, I noticed that I sweated a little more on my face and found that to be very unusual since I normally don't sweat easily, especially on my face.  Overall, I don't like this product very much and will be giving it away."	"Doesn't work if you don't have oily skin"	"bad"

"I read good reviews on this product, so I thought I'd give it a try.  The smell was a bit much, but didn't hang around long. It was the very greasy feeling that was left on my skin that I did not care for.  All other reviews said it was light and \"vanishes\".  Mine did the opposite.  It was like thick vaseline that clung to my face and actually had to be rubbed in for awhile to get it to \"vanish\".  Doesn't all face cream vanish? But it was the very  heavy oily greasy smelly feeling on my skin that was the annoyance. I think I will stick to Olay."	"Grease and Oil"	"bad"

"This product has great reviews but it did not work for me. This is not simply a Knot today, this is never again.I am a mix of Japanese and Black and my hair is very curly.For me, this product does no better than using a shampoo/conditioner combination like Pantene and comb/detangle while washing your hair. Plus it's cheaper.I left the product in my hair like the instructions said and it made my hair limp.I always use Paul Mitchell's super sculpt lotion to define my curls and leaving both products in my hair was too much.The search continues...I would not re-purchase this product."	"Knot today...."	"bad"
"I enjoy the body wash itself, but the tube is a pain to squeeze the product out of and for the record I have strong hands.  I prefer the body wash with the micro beads, but overall the scent and product is good."	"Scent and Feel is Good, Squeezable Bottom Needs Revamping"	"good"
"OK, I heard this is good for dry skin, I have tried it on certain places on my face that is very dry due to treatment for sun damage. It does soften the skin but it kind of hard to blend it in without pulling the skin more than I like to. Mixing it with an almond oil helps liquify it. It's OK"	"Not as thin as I would have liked"	"neutral"
"I bought this after seeing a youtube review of a woman applying this this.  I watched some middle aged woman apply this with what seemed to be very drastic and noticeable results.  I thought that this stuff must be awesome, she was not a model... just an average lady so I thought for sure I could duplicate the fabulous effects.For me it doesn't fill in crevices and wrinkles like it did for the lady in the youtube video (and mine are not nearly what hers were).  What it does do is eliminate SHINE so that they are less noticeable.  However I note that this effect (for me) is limited to an hour or two and my shininess is back.  I do have rather oily skin.It does at least come with a sun screen built in, but I wanted this for the beautifying effects which for me are not there."	"This didn't work very well."	"bad"
"I used this one time and i love the results! im light to med skin tone , neutral and this gave me a really nice bronze looking tan. i had it on for about four hrs. i also i have the origional fb flaw less and this is one is def better as far as color payoff goes. really like this stuffthe only thing is it smells similar to the origional fb but its a little smellier but , you get to shower after an hr so its no biggie , still a great tanner"	"nice bronze tan"	"good"
"As with 99% of all acne and blackhead products on the market, it's yet another formulation of 2% salicylic acid in a mixture. The warming part is interesting upon first use since the product feels very warm on your fingers for about 2 seconds but isn't at all noticeable on your face. Since it's not warm after application, it doesn't seem to add anything to the cleansing action.After two weeks of usage, I wouldn't say this product is better or worse than another other salicylic acid product on the market. The results for me have been the same as every other product I've ever used and there are cheaper products in the supermarket that offer the same treatment."	"Another salicylic acid product - the warming part is a gimmick"	"neutral"
"I have purchased these a few times on amazon and it has been great expect Amazon must have changed the company it purchases its fragrances as this was a cheap knock-off version of the actual eau de toilette. I cannot risk purchases these anymore through Amazon as the customer service rep could not even disclose the manufacture of these fragrances. I am back to buying Amariage on Macy's even if it cost more money... at least i know it is the authentic brans."	"Not actual product"	"bad"
"This cuticle remover is wonderful--you don't need to leave it on very long and the skin sloughs right off. I don't even use a cuticle pusher--just my nail or I wipe the excess cuticle off with a cotton round. I rarely have to trim any cuticle at all because this takes care of most of it. I've also heard it's really good at removing dry skin from feet, so that's something else to try now!Some warnings: It is very watery, so don't expect the creamier stuff they often use at salons. Also, a little goes a very long way so, unless you're a nail salon, you do not need the 32 oz bottle. That' what I got and I filled a small container and over the last 4 months or so, I've barely made a dent in it. This is going to last me forever.Overall, highly recommend this product. Like it much more than the pink Formula 10 stuff I'd been using before, which really didn't work for me."	"Works perfectly!"	"good"
"I a m in love with this palette. I love the colors, I love that they don't smell bad, I love how they look with or without primer. That being said, they are brittle. Have a light touch when using to avoid needing to vacuum up makeup crumbles!"	"Gorgeous colors!"	"neutral"
"I have very oily skin.  It's a curse, I know.  Because of that, I usually look for products that claim to handle that issue.  This Axe face wash is called `Controil' and is targeted at that particular problem.  Sadly, it doesn't work that wonderfully, or at least for that long.  Granted, if I shower in the morning then I can get until the evening before feeling the need to wash my face again, but if I don't have the time to shower then this product doesn't really do the trick.  Washing my face in the morning gets me till about lunchtime or there abouts before I'm feeling the need to wash my face again.  The smell is also VERY strong and distinct and kind of off putting.  It has a very artificial smell.  I won't be reaching for this product again."	"It doesn't control a whole lot..."	"bad"

"I really liked this mirror at first - it seemed like such a good (though spartan) design.However, after a few months, it's developed a cloudy haze that just won't clean off:  I've tried everything, even toothpaste, but it almost seems as if the surface of the mirror has changed.I had to throw it away,Not recommended."

"I usually like Olay products, but this body wash gave me a rash.  I have lupus, and my skin is really sensitive, so it could just be me.However, there are a few controversial ingredients in this body wash that you may also want to avoid if you've got allergies or eczema or any such icky skin things.  The body wash is full of sulfates.  Those don't bother me, but they do bother some people.  It's also got both petrolatum, which does cause problems for me, and mineral oil, which I can't use.I should have checked the label before I used it.All that said, it left my skin soft and smelling nice.  I would use it if I could."	"Not Great for Sensitive Skin"	"neutral"

"This product makes your hairstyle shiny and bouncy BUT I have sensitive skin and it made me itch a little.If you can find a local salon that uses this haircare line and you have sensitive skin, I recommend having your stylist use it on you or request a sample to test at home on your skin first.I don't think it would work for \"high\" or really firm hairstyles but it seems to work well for my wavy, soft shoulder-length styles.  I still use it occasionally in spite of the mild itchy reaction I get.This review & product could go either way for you- caveat emptor !  \"Let the buyer beware\"...  it might not be for you or it might be the best thing you've ever tried!On a SIDE NOTE - I HIGHLY recommend the Shampoo and Leave-in Treatments in this same line those are FABULOUS even with my crazy skin & scalp!Four Seasons Beauty Boutique through the Amazon shopping website seems to have the best prices on this product that I have found and great customer service.Enjoy!Lisa"	"This one bothered my sensitive scalp A LITTLE"	"neutral"
"I have naturally curly hair. My hair is not dry or oily. (I use products for \"normal\" or \"thick\" hair types.) My hair is thick and long. This means that I use between 2 and 3 bottles of conditioner for every 1 bottle of shampoo. When I received a bottle of Nexxus Hydralight Weighless Moisture Leave-In Conditioning Foam I was excited. I thought this would replace all those bottles of conditioner. However, no matter how I use this product I am disappointed.\"Moisture\" must be another word for greasy or oily. I tried using this product after shampooing, with my hair still wet and no bottle conditioner. I tried after shampooing and using conditioner. I even tried on already dry hair. All gave the same result: flattened, greasy hair. Each time, I had to shampoo twice to get all the grease out.This product does nothing about tangling. But then again, the bottle never claimed to help with snares.Of all the products I've tried, Pantene is still the best conditioner out there.Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews."	"I tried using this product on my hair every way that I could think of."	"bad"
"I have always liked this conditioner, leaves hair soft, not always soft enough for me (since I have pretty dry hair) but if you have only slightly dried hair then this would be a Godsend for you...plus at its great price, its a great conditioner to have on hand :) plus the smell is GREAT !"

"Now I will admit I am new to wearing lipstick.  I've never liked the feeling on my lips and because I have very full lips I've always just gone au natural in the past.  I do like the color.  I do like it's opacity.  It feels dry so I'd definitely recommend using a gloss or a balm underneath.  My biggest gripe with the lipstick is the smell.  Being so close to the nose it's my opinion it should be odorless if at all possible.  I do not think it smells like vanilla. I'm not sure what it smells like but it's not good nor bad ...just weird. I am intrigued with lipstick but I'm probably not going to buy lime crime products again."	"Undecided"	"bad"
"Now I'm not sure that this shampoo is any better than any other conditioning shampoo, but I do absolutely love the floral scent it gives off. It's not chemical-smelling or anything- just kind of pleasant.My hair seems pretty clean and shiny too- so really what more could you ask for?"	"smells great!"	"good"
"I didn't see any of the amazing benefits everyone else claims to have seen. Granted I don't have wrinkles or fine lines yet, but I did hope it would help with some of the acne marks I had, but it did not. Plus, it left my skin super oily up to two days after use. Of course each person's skin will react differently, but this didn't really work for my skin. It may work for you?Greetings from beautiful Armenia. :)"	"Left my skin oily"	"neutral"

"I received this product in exchange for a review on my blog.The serum helped add extra moisture to my skin, but it did not replace my moisturizer. While I haven't used it enough to say that it helped reduce the fine lines on my face, it did help keep my complexion clear. I also feel as if the skin on my face looked brighter.You can read my full review here: [...]"	"It works as expected"	"good"
"I like the lighter fragrances of this new Dove line of hair care products, but this root lift spray doesn't seem to do all that much for my hair. Regular mouse works better. I do however like their newDove Hair Styling Oxygen Moisture Leave In Foam, which gives my hair body, a bit of lift and just a touch of texture to help it hold it's style. I've tired this root lift spray on my hair when it's wet and dry, and I just don't get much of any results from it. Not enough that I would get another bottle. But the Dove Leave In Foam, that stuff is great."	"Great fragrance but minimal lift"	"neutral"

"I am really impressed by this straightener, especially at it's present price point.  It seems well made and its wet/dry feature makes it nicer than some other products.  Our family owns several straighteners, including several other Remington products.  With a family of six, which includes four females, these get frequent use.The package includes the S7230 straightener and a user pamphlet.  The straightener has a 6 foot long cord with a swivel base.The S7230 has a 2\" plate surface.  The plates are ceraminc and are infused with soy. These are supposed to condition the hair and last the lifetime of the plates.  I don't know that I've ever seen any difference from any \"infused\" plate versus an untreated ceramic plate.  What I do know is that this straightener works very nicely.  The edge around the plates have vents which allow the moisture from your wet hair to vaporize and rise out of the vent holes atop the straightener.Temperature is set by a rotary dial.  You use lower temperatures for dry hair, higher for wet)  It has a range of 30 temperature settings.  It has an on/off indicator light, and the LED on it changes from amber (heat settings 1 thru 19, for dry hair) or green (settings 20 to 30 for wet hair.  Heating is quick.  The straightener will reach its top temperature (425 degrees) in a minute.The S7230 is adequate as a dry straightener.  It is on wet hair that the product excels.  My daughters all have long hair, have a ritual of washing and conditioning, followed by blow drying and straightening.  However, with the S7230, they find they can skip the blow drying in almost all cases.  The straightener heats and straightens their hair, while releasing enough moisture through the steam vents, that their hair dries nicely at the same time. Their hair comes out shiny, smooth and just as they like it.  You could, of couse, attempt the same with a non-vented straightener.  Your hair would dry but I don't know that it would come out as nice.This product is very reasonably priced and simple in its execution.  Remington (Spectrum Brands) backs it with a 2 year warranty and a 30 day money back guarantee!NOTE: I have used Spectrum's customer service when a prior product (not this model) stopped working while under warranty.  I did not have a receipt as proof of purchase, but they still honored the warranty, validating it with the date code printed on the product.  For just the cost of the return shipping (a few dollars), they took back the non-working straightener and shipped a brand new one in about a week.Based on the performance, price and the company standing behind its products, I highly recommend this straightener!  If you want to minimize or eliminate the step of blow drying long hair on which you also use a straightener, the S7230 does the trick."	"Let Me Tell You Straight!"	"good"
"My boyfriend normally uses Head and Shoulders for dandruff control and after 4 weeks of use found Clear just a good however Clear left his hair feeling just a little bit greasy after use. His theory is that it maybe it has too much conditioner but the product is just shampoo not a two-in-one product.Also as others noted the shampoo arrived with evidence that it had been leaking. This would be a red flag if I had paid for the product.For the price this is listed at I would recommend Head and Shoulders over Clear."	"Not a good value"	"neutral"
"This order only gets 2 stars because I did not get the stamper pictured - which is what I wanted.  I specifically ordered the stamper shown because of the smaller size.  I already have a double sided stamper, but I sometimes find the length annoying to work with and wanted to try a small one.  That's the only reason I ordered this stamper.  What I received was another double stamper.  When I place an order with Amazon, I expect to get what is pictured - not what someone in a warehouse thinks I should get.  Not happy."

"I ordered this shampoo for my teen/preteen daughters to use.  They have long, thick, fine hair which tangles easily.  I always try to get shampoos for them that will leave their hair shiny and smooth, to help make brushing out easier.First of all, this shampoo does have a pleasant fragrance.  They both love that aspect.  It lathers nicely as well.  However, we are not happy with the other results...Both girls wash their hair every other day, which has never been an issue.  However, with this shampoo, their hair looks greasy the day after the last hair washing, as opposed to the greasy look being noticeable the second day.My younger daughter is having a more difficult time than usual brushing out her hair every time she washes.  This is causing her to use more conditioner, which is only worsening the greasy look issue.  She has also been complaining that her head is itchy - I didn't think much of it at first, but when I finally noticed and thought about it, I realized that the only thing she has changed in her regimen is this shampoo.So for us, it's back to the Dove shampoo that gives them the best results."	"Didn't work well for us"	"neutral"
"It tans you.... but if your can get past the scent of hmmmm, how should I describe it, chemical skin after it reacts with your skin?  The smell is strong and long lasting.  I showered and could still smell the chemical reaction.  Gross.  I will not buy again."	"stinks"	"bad"

"I've used this product about halfway down, and I've found it to be nothing special. As an oil and a sort of primer product, it performs fine. But I've noticed no improvement in my hair breakage, and if you use just a little too much it looks way too oily. It does not weigh my hair down, but that's what I NEED it to do because I have poofy curly hair. Overall I am impressed with Organix products, but I won't be buying this one again."	"Nothing special"	"neutral"

"I was initially impressed with this moisturizer. I am a BzzAgent & received a full size product to try & review. I like the packaging & a little goes a long way & my skin felt softer and definitely more moisturized. Sometimes I get itchy, dry skin in the fall as the weather changes and I avoided that this year. However, my skin did break out instead. My skin is acne prone & it is hard to find a moisturizer that moisturizes without clogging my pores. I wish this line of products included an acne ingredient as well."	"Works well, softer skin"	"good"
"The Toni & Guy Sculpting Powder is an odd experience, indeed! I have never used a product like this before, I have thick, wavy/curly hair that is fine and fly-away. I hoped that trying a product like this might hold it down without weighing it down.The powder is so fine that it is tacky...like silky, salty--if that makes sense? It dulls my hair out a bit, that isn't a big deal since I have to add creams and balms (to keep away frizz and keep from having gigantic hair) that do the same.I think playing with the amount used is the trick. Each person has different ideas about what they want for a look and their hair will react differently to the product, as well. Don't use it once and give up, try it a few times and play with it--it's not a one-size-fits-all product. Just remember to use very little at a time and keep it close to the scalp."

"I wore this as a girl and although that has been decades ago, Chantilly's timeless femininity still resonates. Since I'm a huge fan of sweet fragrances, this certainly fits that bill. But it also has a hint of spice, so like me, it's never TOO sweet. I don't wear this when I dress to go out, but rather after a shower when I'm lounging or working at home. Several well-placed spritzes and I smell like a dream all day long."	"Brings back fond memories"	"good"

"I'll be honest; my problem with this product could be my fault. But I doubt it. I have fair skin and, generally, nearly invisible ash medium blonde/gray brows. I usually color them with light warm brown or dark warm blonde hair color. Or I ask my hairstylist to do it. So I thought it would be fun to try this product and it gets good reviews, for the most part. I followed instructions for using the light brown. My brows are now a Groucho-black-dark, dark, dark (did I mention &#34;dark&#34;?) chocolate-tar-brown. So I'm sitting here, on my bathroom floor, writing this review on my ipad--my little take on this hair dye. This dye could darken tree bark, people. For some of you lovely ones who can use that kind of concentration to color your brows, I am happy for you. You'll be fine, just use caution also. For those who meet my description, do not buy this product in Light Brown, or, better yet, at all.Also,  I know this is wasteful, but buy a well-reviewed hair dye kit like L'Oreal or Clairol, use what you need, and dispose of the rest. In my experience, those are a lot more dependable. And go light. You can always go darker or even carefully apply more once you've removed your first application. And, depending on your face cleanser's ingredients, it will last just about as long as this product."	"NOPE!"	"bad"

"I was very pleased with the moisturizing qualities of this product.  It absorbed quickly, and did not leave any feelings of stickiness.  When I applied it at bedtime my skin still felt, soft, hydrated in the morning.However, the scent which at first seemed innocuous enough really isn't.  It's a fragrance that stays with you, and when the lotion is applied all over the body it can be overwhelming.I've tried using it just as a hand lotion and then going outside to work in the yard.  Even after a few hours of my hands being in less than fragrant dirt the Sheer Infusion scent remains.  Now, that's fine if I'm not going anywhere.  But, if I shower and then apply this lotion before going out in the evening that will be the scent - no use trying to wear my favorite cologne.So, because I like the hydrating quality I'll continue to use this as a hand lotion but would not apply it before going out, and probably would not purchase it for a second time use."

"They are perfect for making 3-dimensional stamping designs. JUST be patient though, these take longer to dry than their other colors, which makes sense because they are thicker to make it 3-d. I have not seen any other nail polish products sold that have the colorful dimension that kleancolor has. They all are beautiful whether used alone or together with their other polishes for stamping. They turn different shades of their specific color ever time you move your hand or the light changes on them. It's like they all have little rainbows in their bottle. You really can't appreciate the colors by looking at pictures or the screen of a computer. It just does not do them justice.These are perfect for adults or teens but I don't think they would make a great present for anyone younger. Not because  there's anything wrong with the polish but because the user really needs to have more patience with these specifically.  The polishes are thicker and take more &#34;talent&#34; to paint your nails and it definitely requires more patience to wait until they are dry. If you want to get these amazing colors for your preteen or younger kleancolor has metallic and so many other sets of colors you can be sure they won't get bored with the same colors. All their sets have absolutely beautiful and brilliant colors that just can't be described. You will not be disappointed by the colors or how easily it spreads on your nails, how long the color lasts or how long your manicure lasts."	"absolutely loved these colors"	"good"
"This is good but STRONG!! It takes some getting used too. I was even grossed out, and practically passed out when I first smelled the bottle, but its grown on me over the last couple weeks and I wear it sometimes, (when Im home, dont wanna scare people, haha!!) its really, really strong.

The smell is wonderful but not overpowering.  The only thing is that I wish it came in a larger economy size bottle.  Highly recommend!"	"Awesome body wash"	"good"

"I was not that impressed with this product. I read that people had to take days off and not go in public because the skin flaking was so bad. I didn't have hardly any flaking. I followed the directions that were provided with the kit. It did help some acne that I had on my chin.I decided to do a second peel only this time follow some directions off you tube. I left the peel on for 3 hrs and washed with only water. I used only emu oil but only the day after I applied the peel. I had more skin flaking than the first time but again it was minimal.So I don't know if it is truly medical/professional grade peel. The peel has helped my face some but not like most reported. I'm going to finish the 6 peel cycle out of this bottle but I won't waste my time taking days off work to use this product."	"disappointed"	"bad"
"This is definitely my favorite as far a great color that can stand alone or as a top coat or in French manicure. The color is a very light opalescent pink. I great so many compliments.

"My nails are always constantly chipping and peeling. They're just not strong enough, so I'm always searching for and trying anything that will help them grow and be strong. I tried the Sally Hansen Hard as Wraps nail treatment and although my results weren't great they were not horrible either.My nails did appear stronger when I first applied this product which is why I'm not complaining. The problem lies with the coat just peeling off in one big sheet. It only lasted about 2 days. Even if I try applying it every day or every other day it still peels right off. Which leaves me right back to where I left off. Once the top layer peels off my nails feel weak and in need of another top coat.That being said for the two days it's not bad. I just wish it would last longer and not try to peel off so easily."	"Not amazing."	"bad"
"If you have been using the Tresemme 7 Day Keratin Smooth Treatment, this conditioner is an absolute must and not just for the time during treatment.

I use it along with the & Day Keratin Smooth shampoo, even when I'm not using the treatment. I love it!"	"A must for users of the 7 day keratin treatment"	"good"
"I love this hair clip. It is so pretty  and just the right size. Not to big and not to small. The stones are really shiny. After wearing it today I received so many  compliments. I am adding on to my original review since sadly after wearing this pretty hair clip a few times I went to put it in my hair today and the back of the clip broke off and is now unusable. If you are really careful with it and not try to put to much hair into the clip it probably will not break. It is very pretty"	"Very Pretty"	"neutral"

Don't like and I won't even give these to my mom cause she would just look silly. The pic online is not what they look like when you stencil them on,there's no thin line part at the end it's a little bit thinner than the front bigger part and it looks horrible..

"The original Translucent extra coverage is a must have classic.  Goes on smooth, lasts all day even in humidity (we're talking 100 degrees and 98% humidity).  Just amazing.  I read some reviews saying the luminous is great for highlighter; sadly, no.  Guess I'm old; in my day you did not want to look shiny... That's the point of powder, to stop the shiny, oily, sweaty look.  And at my age, you certainly do not want to look sparkly either (reeks of &#34;trying to be young&#34;).  I was hoping for a more pearl-like finish, but it is definitely unfortunately sparkles.  You may not notice indoors, but in sunlight, it is like little micro glitter everywhere."

"Case is 10\" long x 6.5\" wide x 3.5\" deep.  Product comes with 1 case, 32 eyeshadows, 4 lipsticks, 4 nail vanishes, 2 blushers, 1 big blush brush, 1 mini blush brush, 1 eyebrow brush, 1 mirror box, 3 applicators, 1 double-ended lip pencil, and 1 double-ended eye pencil.  (Colors may vary, e.g., we did not get the rose red nail vanish like in Amazon's picture.)Here's what wrong with it.  The eye and lip pencils do not go on very dark, and so do the lipsticks.  The blush brushes aren't soft and thick and therefore do not pick up and apply blush well.  Eyeshadows also go on light and do not blend well.  The eyebrow brush is useless.  Mirror box and pencil tips were broken when being removed from elastic bands because elastic bands tightly hold both ends of the double-ended eye and lip pencils, etc., and case is small with little room to wiggle.Bought for niece, and the feedback from her was not a positive one.  What can I say?!  I never knew \"real\" makeup cost up to hundreds of dollars.  According to my dear niece, the only things that were \"useable\" were the applicators.  She gave everything else to her little sis to play makeup with.So, the lesson learned is this is good value if you plan to buy it for young or preteen girls to play with.  Buy the real deal for teenage or girls who use serious makeup, which makes sense because how can you look like a million bucks with a 19-dollar makeup set?!!"	"Not \"serious\" makeup"	"neutral"
"The beauty market is always flourishing because as women we want to look--and feel--our best. Small indulgences such as a luxurious shampoo or Sephora grade make-up item can serve as a nice little pick me up from time to time. Being subject to many sleepless nights (insomniac here!), I have been exposed to more than one infomercial; Chaz Dean's seems to be the \"it\" infomercial of the moment.So after much exposure to the name, I bit the hook, line and sinker. I have been using WEN for a month now. Now, this is where some disclaiming comes into play:-I have very thin, fine hair-My hair gets greasy easily (by the end of the day)-My hair is heavily processed via dyeWEN *claims* to be for ALL hair types, but I am skeptical regarding such a claim. WEN is thick like a conditioner. I use it EXACTLY as directed and find that it is 1. FAR too heavy for my hair type and 2. It leaves my hair tangled!!! The latter part is very baffling to me because conditioner typically makes hair easy to comb through and manage. I do not have a scientific explanation for this phenomenon; it is possible that WEN does not CLEAN the hair well enough. By the second week it seriously felt as if I had just washed my hair with water alone. Have any of you ever done that? Try brushing your hair after you swim in a pool; that's the best way to explain the results that I have gotten and am getting (well, I have just discontinued using WEN) via this product.Maybe WEN works best for women with thick, course hair? I have friends that only need to wash their hair once every 3-4 days (and they always seem embarrassed when they confess this to me, as if I'll judge their hygiene practices or something?); as earlier stated, I am NOT one of those women.I understand that WEN might have a fan base. I know of a woman that praises WEN, swears by it and will use nothing else but WEN. If you find my product review to be \"unhelpful\" simply because you like the product, please keep in mind that products are HIGHLY subjective and they affect all of us uniquely.My advice to all of you curious product junkies out there is to by a SAMPLE SIZE OF THIS PRODUCT. I understand wanting to try it, but I have to be honest and let potential buyers know about my \"less than stellar\" experience with WEN.Now that I am back to \"regular shampoo,\" I can comb my hair again easily. Because I dye my hair, I always make sure to invest in a good deep conditioning treatment.My other major gripe with this \"cleansing conditioner\" is the fact that it is a CHORE to use. WEN is not a once a month treatment; used daily, this product is time consuming. It is ludicrous to use \"xyz\" number of pumps, comb, wait, use \"xyz\" numbers again, rinse for minutes upon minutes... I think you get my drift? For those of us needing to be somewhere ON TIME, WEN is a pain in the butt. The infomercial shows Chaz massaging the head of an actress; it's a fitting image because I am assuming that said actress has the time to be pampered by a hair stylist as she waits for her two hour session with a professional make-up artist. My point here is that I have nothing against the privileged; my problem lies within the premise that this is promoted as a product for the everyday woman. Chaz might be a bit out of touch. Most of us do not want to get up earlier in the morning than we have to in order to accommodate tedious shower rituals.Two other ludicrous issues concerning WEN: 1. auto-delivery 2. the amount of product that has to be used is excessive! Given the price tag, one has to use A LOT OF PRODUCT via the \"official instructions.\" From my experience, good products typically adopt the slogan \"a little goes a long way.\" WEN milks its buyer's for every dime.FINAL VERDICT: WEN made my hair...- greasier-tangled and matted-dull-my hair follicles clogged creating acne like spots (GROSS, I know, but be forewarned...)-I noticed hair lossThe verdict? WEN= FAIL.Ps- I do realize that my hair, being damaged and processed, might not get miraculous results; I get it. However, I've never had a product make my damaged hair WORSE OFF. I feel that others with my hair type should be aware of what they are getting themselves into- ESPECIALLY at this price tag!You might try it and love it. Good luck and well wishes!"

"I love asian skincare, so of course I had to try this cleanser. I even like the name, Perfect Whip.  However, this is only good if you don't wear makeup or remove your makeup prior to washing your face.Yes, this cleanser is fabulously foamy, but just because it is foamy, doesn't mean it is removing impurities.  The good thing is, you only need to use a teeny tiny amount and the cleanser will create an incredibly rich lather, and doesnt dry out the skin.  I can use this cleanser in the morning and it seems fine, however I can't use it at night.  The bad thing about this cleanser is that it doesn't completely get rid of makeup.  I wear foundation and powder and even though I washed my face twice with this cleanser, I had to use about 6 cotton balls with toner to get rid of all the remaining traces of dirt and makeup left on my skin.  I am breakout prone, so I like to make sure all makeup/dirt is removed from my face before bed.  To me, if there is still dirt or makeup residue on your face after cleansing, then that is not a good cleanser, which is why I don't recommend this cleanser if you wear foundation, concealer, or powder."

"I bought this glove to use with a clipless curling iron, needless to say it did NOT do the job! I didn't realize that on the outside of the package that said \"This glove will not protect from touching the iron plates directly\" and that's exactly how I use the curling iron.It is just like the body scrub gloves, like a scratchy mesh material, and the heat went right thru, was not able to hold a curl on the iron for more than 3 seconds or my hand was gonna get burnt. VERY disappointed about this. Sent it back and got a refund."	"READ the FINE print!!"	"bad"

The cotton ball does have dirt left on it after an treatment looks slightly brownish grey could vary."	"Remarkable suction"	"good"
"I liked the feel of it, light yet still some coverage, but it tends to have a powdery residue/feel, and if you have any dry skin at all, it adhere's to it and looks bad.  It did help me realize that I needed more moisture!  Once I got more moisturized, it helped, but in wearing this on half my face, and a different makeup on the other half, I've noticed I break out more where I use this makeup.  I do have pretty sensitive skin though.  It might work better for others than it did for me."	"mixed feelings"	"neutral"
"When you read the label, it sounds like a great product. I just can't use it without it burning my eyes. It's sooo thick that it takes forever to rinse and even then I don't get it all because as soon as I open my eyes I can feel the burn.  I even tried thinning it down with water. I thought that if it was thinner it would rinse away easier but that didn't help either. I can't use it - which is a shame because on principle I like Alba products."

Even after a week of purchasing this product it stinks.... who knows what kind of chemicals are in the plastic. Not for us!UPDATED ON 05/20/13The company has great customer service. They contacted me and sent a new brush. This one was purple instead of pink. The new brush didn't smell bad at all and actually works great on my 3 year old old curly hair. The original brush I bought was pink and the horrible smell started to fade now. Thanks for such a good customer service!"	"Awful smell!!!! - REVIEW UPDATED"	"good"

"This iron is mid-sized between my tiny compact travel irons and a full size flat iron. I have naturally bone-straight hair, but prefer to use flat irons to style it vs. curling irons.The front is very bleach-damaged, the back is shiny and healthy. This iron is NOT for styling straight or fine hair. I've always used flat irons, and none of them have destroyed my hair like this iron has. I noticed the ends started to look a little cooked, and within a few days my hair was noticeably burned at the ends.Outside of how my hair reacted to it, it is a very fine little iron. The 'floating' plates have a very slight amount of give, very minimal, but they are smooth and it does do the job. It just isn't suitable for me.There is no temp control, so I will have to give this away."	"Destroyed my hair"	"neutral"

"This product creates a really cool look with a bump up.  I use it wearing a ponytail or down.  I have had several compliments on the look it creates and the best part is that it doesn't pinch behind my ears or pressure my scalp!

"Really cool look"	"good"
"I like the way this conditioner makes my hair feel. It's soft and it doesn't weigh it down. It rinses out well, leaving just enough behind to do the trick. My only complaint is the scent. I thought I would love it because of the description. Unfortunately, it reminded me a little of pine floor cleaner. I expected a clean, floral scent - or perhaps an ocean breeze. I didn't get that, it seemed artificial and almost line pine or juniper. It's definitely not my favorite from the Suave natural infusions line."

"This and theDeva Curl Styling Cream 5.1ozare the two newest products in the Deva lineup, and I picked both up the other day locally. The Spray Gel is targeted towards all of Deva's curl types -- S'Wavy, Wavy, Botticelli, and Corkscrew.  I have wavy hair, and have been using this mostly to spray on my roots (after I clip them for volume) and on my ends (where I tend to accidentally go light on my Deva AnGel).  I really like it!  The spray comes out easily, and it's nice to be able to target those areas of your hair where you are missing gel.I haven't yet used it on its own instead of AnGel since it seems like you'd really have to use a lot to get coverage, but for spot areas it works great.  You can also use it on second- and third-day hair to revitalize your gel, without adding tackiness.The directions on the bottle are as follows:  \"For added volume, lift and definition, use DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam and follow with Spray Gel to roots and crown to define and separate.\"When I started following the Curly Girl method a little over a year ago, I actually used other brands, before finally trying out the Deva line.  I've been using it exclusively for a few months, and my hair has never looked better.  My red color hardly fades, and my waves are shiny and healthy. I really love their products!"

They've been kind to my skin and I think using the products have given my skin a healthier look."	"It does the job of cleaning"	"neutral"
"I bought this soap based on all the positive reviews, and the interesting combination of scents. The only positive thing I can say about this soap is that you get a ton of it for the price. Unfortunately, it is a very thin liquid that produces almost no lather. I don't see where it has any significant cleaning properties at all, and would never use this as a shampoo (although the label suggests you can). The coconut-lemon scent is the most disappointing. The coconut is not  even remotely discernible because it is so overpowered by the strong lemon smell. I feel like I'm bathing with dishwashing liquid. I'll accept that this is an all-natural product, whatever that means, but the ingredients label reads like the contents of a chemistry set. But natural or not, I still expected this soap to lather, clean and smell nice, but it falls short in all categories."	"No redeeming qualities to this disappointing product"	"bad"

"I have a fair amount of short, fine textured curly hair.  I used to use a combo of products to get the curls to remain frizz free and defined until I switched hairstylists and she used the B-leave in on my hair when cutting it the first time....and this was all she used.  I was amazed at how well it worked.  She didn't sell it in the salon at that point ( had run out) so I searched and found it on Amazon and thought it was pricey to start with, but ordered it anyway...I dont' normally buy salon products, but found out that the 16 oz size ( comes in a pump, not tube) lasts me almost 4 months for my short- medium hair.  You do need to use a lot for it to work well...I use 2 full pumps on my wet hair and 1 more small pump to finish it once dried w/ a diffuser. Most of the time I use nothing else other than hairspray.  If I want more of a shiny, crunchy look, then I may also apply just a quarter size amount of mousse but that's only on wet rainy days when I want extra protection.  Keep in mind this is NOT a a leave in conditioner, it's a styling product."	"Love this stuff!"	"good"

"I have to admit that I'm not very good at styling my hair...but I do have a Sedu Revolution Flat Iron that I do fabulous curls with so I'm not a total retard in that aspect.  I wanted to try this out because it's a totally different way of curling hair and therefore would be able to do the spiral curls that would be very pretty...and I cannot do with my flat iron.  Well...that was the theory, anyways.This items comes with a pink curling wand and one heat resistant glove.  You will need the glove.  It was very quick to come up to heat and that's about the end of the pros.  I have layered hair and I couldn't get good results with this wand.  I guess maybe if all your hair was the same length, you would just grab a section of hair and wrap it around the wand.  If you have layered hair though, you get a lot of frizzies sticking out as you're trying to wind the section of hair around the wand.  The few curls that I did manage to get, the curls felt dried and burnt.  Not like my Sedu flat iron which comes out bouncy and soft.  I really needed to use the glove so that I wouldn't keep burning myself, yet the glove made it so that I couldn't feel my hair very well and I couldn't manipulate my hair properly.  All in all - I wasn't able to curl all my hair with this thing and just got frustrated so I stopped.I would not recommend this item unless if you really know how to work a wand type curler.  If you do...then this one does work.  It gets up to heat properly and does make some pretty curls.  It's just not for me."	"Not for layered hair"	"bad"

And once I did finally decide I wanted Coquette it wasn't even available!! So once it became available again my next purchase was Great Pink Planet and the Coquette. The Great Pink Planet lipstick looks really pretty and very moisturizing just like the Coquette and Countessa. But, the Coquette is defiantly my favorite so far by Lime Crime!!!

It has a pleasant scent too; kinda like a grapefruit or something. I use this along with the the Slim Extreme 3D Super Concentrated Firming Buttocks Serum (smells really good), which is more like a cream than a gel like this one. I use them both 2x daily, after my morning shower and before going to bed at night. I apply this one 1st and then the SCFBS 2nd. I can say that my skin is super soft with a slight burning sensation about 5-7 minutes after applying both. I also noticed when I did a 30 walk on the treadmill the other day which was about an half hour after applying the 2 together, that I sweat a lot and when I did finish my butt, thighs, and abdomen were burning again. So I'm sure you re-ignite the &#34;hot sensation&#34; if you work out with it , which in terms helps burn more calories. So until I measure I can't say if it is helping me shed, but it should be cause I walk all day long at work. I've also noticed that some of the cellulite in my thigh/buttock area is not as noticeable. I can feel my thighs and butt also beginning to firm, because my skin feels smoother and tighter. Can't say which is making it happen but it's happening. SO 3 STARS FOR NOW ****WILL DO A 2ND REVIEW****"	"TURN UP THE HEAT!!!"	"neutral"
"I have very sunburn prone skin, have a history of melanoma and as a result, I'm a bit of a sunscreen connoisseur, if you will.  :) I bought this because I was looking for a non-chemically sunscreen for every day use on my arms and this one had some reviews that said it was non streaky.  I love Jason's other products, especially the 30 spf face lotion so I gave this a try.  It is truly odor free, which is nice.  But.  It has a very thick and kind of clumpy texture and after a while (a couple of months), the ingredients separate a little so when I squeeze it, liquid comes out and then solid.  To remedy this, I squeeze it around in the tube before I squeeze it out.  If I wipe it in REALLY hard, I just look pale(r).  But if I'm not careful, it's really streaky.  Overall, I'm not super impressed and wouldn't buy it again."	"Odd Texture, Separates a bit and is Streaky"	"bad"
"I have combination skin and tend to get oily in the middle of the afternoon each day. So... as soon as I get home from work and dinner started, I wash me makeup off. You really need to use a gentle cleanser first to get eye makeup, etc off first. I use Oil of Olay and then I use this cleanser. This cleanser really gives you a deep clean, especially if you use the a clarisonic brush. Even though I tend to have oily skin, this cleanser is a bit strong for me.I use this cleanser, my antioxidant/antiaging serum, and then a good moisturizer. Then at night right before bed, I apply my Retin A. In the morning my skin usually looks flawless. However.... some mornings you can tell that the Glytone put me just over the edge and my skin is a little flaky. I usually skip the Glytone that night to give my skin a bit of a break and then start using it again the next day.Also, because it really gets deeps down in to your pores, whatever you put on after whether it be a moisturizer or some sort of serum... it might slightly burn. But this goes away in a few minutes.Overall I like how clean my skin feels after using this product but only time will tell if it will shrink pores, get rid of all pore clogging gunk, and reduce wrinkles."

"This product is advertised as a  \"Scalp & Hair Beauty Therapy\" and it is. I have a dry scalp and this has been helping. This product seems to not be advertised correctly though it does what it advertises.  Be aware that there are no instructions on its proper use. The oils needed to aid your skin is contained within a petroleum jelly base and this is what you apply. I apply a small dab directly too the scalp after you have dried your hair and I actually avoid getting on my hair as much as possible. If this was the 1950's the 'Greasers' would be using this too slick back their hair. I look at this as a treatment and not a product used all the time. If you get this in your hair it will be like you put petroleum jelly in it and you will have a hard time washing this out.  Note: Though I do not put this on my hair in very small quantities it would add a shine too your hair."	"Old style product that requires moderation"	"neutral"

"I'm reviewing on my dad's account. This bottle has saved my nails from the dreaded bed marks. The only downside is that it isn't really 10 days antichip. I put it on, and the next day, it chipped pretty badly on the front part of my index finger. I guess it depends on what you do during the day. But I would highly recommend. Just make sure you don't put a thick layer on, because it'll take a bit longer to fully dry. Air bubbles aren't too much of a problem either, just make sure you smooth the polish down evenly :)"	"Awesome product!"	"good"

"First impression: The Argan Oil comes in a nice glass bottle with a dropper. It is 100% pure, so it does have a sour smell. The sour smell does throw me off because I like my beauty products to have an appealing smell. Considering that it is pure and multi-use, I can deal with the smell.My Thoughts: I love Argan Oil. It is a miracle product in my opinion. I especially like this one because you can use it on anything! You can use it as cuticle oil for your nails. You can use it to smooth and shine your hair. It can also be put on your face and skin to moisturize and soften your skin. You entire body will be left looking healthy and refreshed! Great Product!"	"Love it!! Can be used for so many things!"

"The stuff smell great, but resembles Vaseline in thickness. Am I supposed to heat this stuff? Wash my hair and clop it in? Try and get it in my scalp? So I tried to rub it in my scalp. By the time I was done, I could have put on leathers, a T-shirt, rolled a pack of smokes up in the arm, tucked a smoke behind the ear, and time-traveled back to 1955. Total greaser. OK, so I let the stuff stay in my hair while I worked around the house.  About three ours later I took a shower. Shampoo #1. About 25% came out. Shampoo #2. A little more. Figured I would leave it at that.My hair was still \"greasy.\" Next day, my hair looked limp and lifeless, and my scalp was constantly itchy.I'm not sure who this is marketed for. With no information, it's a gamble.  If you need a product for a 1950's Greaser look, you're all set. For my hair (I'm a 50+ white male) it's a waste of time. The product probably works great for the right scalp and hair type, but the marketing manager for this product needs to be fired."	"No instructions, no information, guessing on how to use it!"	"bad"

"This wipes work fine for removing make up or freshening up your face but they made me break out. I'm not sure if it is the Vitamin C or something else added. They smell nice, so I am keeping them in a drawer at work for occasional use of freshening up or when I spill something on my clothes, they have been useful for that. If you have sensitive skin, you probably don't want to use these. I also think you can certainly find another product for less money that works better and isn't such a waste of product."

"I used the Shiseido Extra Smooth Sun Protection Cream SPF 38 before trying this and I loved that one. It was a great primer, helped control my oil, and it didn't smell like sunscreen although it had a particular scent. The Obagi sunscreen has a strong chemical scent and has a more liquid consistency. I've heard that you are supposed to pat facial sunscreen onto your skin instead of rubbing it in and since this isn't very thick and is more watery I don't feel like my face is fully protected. I've also noticed that when I apply mineral makeup it sometimes clumps up with the sunscreen and forms little chunks. I'll try rubbing in the sunscreen instead of patting it on and see if it makes a difference with mineral makeup application but I definitely prefer the Shisedo one over this."

"I've come across this product a few times, but never purchased it because every time I give it a trial run, I'm just not that impressed. It's a sheer brownish-berry lipstick, which is pretty, but I can get the same effect by applying lipbalm and then lightly using a dark lipstick over it. Although I'm Caucasian, I frequently use this application method with darker lipsticks marketed to African-American women. I get some lovely sheer stained effects. You can also use Revlon's Raisin Rage or Blackberry or Black Cherry lipsticks over balm for a Black Honey dupe. In fact, the Clinique product doesn't work as well as my homespun versions. It lasts maybe an hour tops, feels thin and drying to my lips, and I consider a .07-ounce product for almost $20 to be a ripoff."	"Sorry to spoil the party, but I'm not that impressed"	"bad"
"My daughter has weird hair.  It's fine and blonde, but very textures in the back.  Her preschool kept putting her hair in ponytails, and I hate it.  She hated it.She's 18 months - who cares if her hair is a mess of frizz?  Don't torture her with rubberbands.Anyway, I tried this product and suddenly instead of frizz, the back of her head is now filled with ringlets.  It's just amazing.  It's not at all crunchy/sticky.In the morning, to combat bead-head, I dampen my daughters hair with my wet hands and then spray this into her hair a couple of times.  Scrunch it, and for the rest of the day it's just perfect soft curls instead of frizz.  No more rubberbands!Great."	"Great for crazy baby hair"	"good"
"These come in a foil package with an adhesive tab that opens to pull out one wipe.  There are 25 wipes in a package.  I received one package from vine.These are the kind of paper cloth that you find in all wipes.  It states on the package that it will remove waterproof mascara.  It also states on the package it is kind to skin.This is very different from what I usually use to take off makeup.  I have dry, sensitive skin and while I do not wear waterproof mascara I do wear dark, heavy eye makeup.I held the wipe on my eye for a few seconds, and it did take off some, but not all of the eye makeup.  To get all the makeup off I needed to rub some.  They easily took off foundation and blush.These are similar to other wipes I have used, but I do think they are slightly milder.  There is no alcohol, perfume or dye and when you have sensitive skin those kinds of things are important.  There is cetearyl alcohol that is a waxy substance that helps lotions feel creamy and makes skin feel smoother, it is not the same as drying alcohol.  So when the front says no alcohol they are talking about the drying kind of alcohol.I don't think that I would use these every day, but for travel or when you need to get makeup off quickly I think that these would be ideal."

Bad, bad stuff....It took me so long to get my hair back to normal, it takes lots of deep conditioning, I used Deeeep by Bumble and Bumble and its getting there slowly, I wish they would stop selling it....It smells like very strong perm chemicals and it tangles your hair....I cant go on, it makes me mad....

"I wasn't expecting miracles but I am a little disapointed in this product. The eye primer made my eyes feel greasy, even with just a tiny bit. It did not prevent creasing and my eye makeup still came off after a few hours. The brightening facial primer did not do anything. I already have a clear complexion but I was hoping for a product that made my skin appear less dull. This is not the product for that. I tried the primer for smaller pores today, I did notice a slight change, but not worth the money of this product."	"Eye and facial primer"	"neutral"

"The Moisture Plus Conditioner by Motions at Home provides ALL hair types a wonderfully luxurious conditioning. It's not just for coarse hair as marketed. I used this with a plastic cap and left on for about 20 minutes. It does have a pleasant fragrance but it is a bit strong. The only drawback was it didn't rinse out as easily as other oil based conditioners but the way it leaves your hair is worth the extra minute of rinsing. All in all, a very good product."	"Heavy Conditioning"	"good"
"I was doubtful at first.  I usually avoid foundations because I have oily skin, and I'm prone to breaking out.  But, because of all the great reviews, I decided to give this a try.To give you an idea of how I used this product, I basically carried on with my usual routine of moisturizer.  But I skipped the SPF so I wouldn't have on too many layers.  I applied the Outlast Stay Fabulous 3 in 1 using a brush the first day.  The coverage was really nice and buildable.  Also, the finish was surprising smooth and matte.On my oily/combination skin, the product lasted about 5 to 6 hours which is pretty impressive.  I had to blot my skin every couple hours so that took away from the product.  But it was easy enough to apply more to spots that needed extra coverage.On the second day, I used my fingers to apply the Outlast 3 in 1.  I liked this application better as the product looked more blended into my skin and pores.  The amount of time the Outlast stayed on my face was basically the same as with the brush application, about 5 to 6 hours.Overall, I give this 3 out of 5 stars because it exceeded my expectations.  I like the finish of the product.  I like that it has a primer in the formula which helps us oily skinned people out.  I like that this is a drug store product that doesn't break the bank or break out my sensitive skin.  I like how the color stayed true throughout the day with minimal oxidation (I've heard that some of the darker colors in this line may change more dramatically after it sets).What I didn't like was the cheap pump and the clear top.  Compared to the glass container the foundation comes in, the top and pump made the product feel cheaper. More importantly, I wish the product wasn't scented.  I'm worried my skin will become sensitized to the fragrance.  It's a very light smell but irritating to me none the less.Overall, I would recommend this product if you are looking for a bargain foundation.Note: I have light skin with yellow undertones and a lot of redness and acne scars.  Buff Beige in number 305 worked for me.  I had to test a couple of shades on my wrist to match my complexion.  I prefer a lighter color rather than a darker one because I can always add bronzer.  Also, I would recommend you use a powder to set this foundation to avoid having to blot your skin like I had to do.  I hope this helps!"	"Good for a drugstore option"	"neutral"
"At least one of the other reviewers is obviously involved in the company. They have a ton of awkward reviews for real Techniques brushes raving about the youtube videos and where exactly you can buy them all.I wanted the sigma f84 but this was cheaper and had a five star rating so I bought it anyway. It's crap. totally different. This brush is completely flat so you have to use it like you are spackling your face rather then blending it in. The bristles are far too long and do not keep their shape while applying foundation. All in all, a waste of money."	"fake reviews"	"bad"
"This cologne has a nice fresh smell. It is one of my favorites and for the price you can't beat it. I absolutely hate the look of the bottle, it reminds me of lipstick, but you don't purchase cologne to look at itso no big deal."	"Fresh"	"good"

I know my review isn't for dandruff relief and it's very different from others but, for me, this product is not worthwhile!

"These lashes had a very natural appearance when on and I would definitely recommend them for anybody with sparse or short lashes to add a little bit of extra volume. The tools and glue that came with the lashed were not the best however, the glue was difficult to get out of the container and would often bubble up when trying to put the lid back on. The brush was also completely unnecessary for anybody used to putting false lashes on. Final verdict: great natural looking lashes, buy a different lash glue."	"Great natural appearance"	"neutral"
"To be honest, I was not able to really test this because it arrived broken. I noticed when I opened the package that there was green powder all over the corner of the cardboard box it was packaged in and when I opened the palette I found that one of the green eye shadows was broken and the crumbled pieces were spread all over the other colors with green powder everywhere. I purchased this as a Christmas gift so it was in no shape to give to someone. I just returned it and I ordered it again so hopefully this will be a better experience."	"Arrived Broken"	"bad"
"i was using the DuDu soap for over a year.  It's been great for the body, but about 1 week after posting my review (2 weeks after receiving it), my face broke out in hives.  It's not the soap's fault, nor the manufacturer, i just have this very sensitive skin.  I wound up going back to using my old stand by: \"Kiss My Face\" Olive oil soap, while using the DUDU on the body.i decided to try a different brand, and started shopping.  Nubian heritage came up.  I gave it a try on the same sensitive area.  There has not been any break outs, hives, nothing.  The Kiss My Face is okay - but my skin looks cleaner, and has a softer feel to it when using the Nubian heritage.i've been washing with it for 3 weeks, and crossing my fingers, no break outs or itching. Plus, it's about $.50 cheaper than DuDu..depending on the seller. if you buy it from Swansons, where i first discovered it? it's $2.61 a bar."	"this one is a better soap for me..."	"good"
"I made a mistake when I ordered this curling iron - I should have researched it first.  I have mid-neck length hair and although it appears that my hair should be long enough for this curling iron, it is not.  I'm fairly coordinated and have used a curling iron for years and thought that not having the clamp on the curling iron would be a plus, but it is a big deterrent.  Yes, you can get a crimp mark in your hair with the clamp if you're not careful, but unless your hair is fairly long, I don't know how you can get your hair to stay on the barrel.  The curling iron comes with a glove that you are instructed to wear which seems like a plus, but it felt odd to have it on.  The glove sort of helped, but the manual warns that you can get burned even when wearing the glove, so I wasn't keen on keeping the gloved hand on the barrel, so my hair kept sliding off.  Also, I wasn't sure how hot it was going to get since the heat dial didn't have any settings - even \"high\", \"medium\" and \"low\" would've helped.  I ended up with a few wavy curls, but it took much longer to style my hair than with a normal curling iron and I'm not crazy enough about this one to practice using it."	"Don't love it"	"neutral"
"This is a Sunscreen.Gals and guys, I'm not saying it has SPF. I mean this is a totally sunscreen sunscreen.

"I was actually surprised when I saw how clean my hair was - squeaky clean, but got disenchanted with the lack of moisture and the tangle mess afterwards. It is recommended to be used only once a week, and seeing the results, once a week it is.The shampoo is more like a creamy hair gel texture, thick but not impossible to lather.  The cap seems to be cheaply made because the bottle leaks when standing - in fact, the cap popped open during shipping making a mess in the bag and it was hard to keep it from leaking in the tub eventhough I pressed all the way to keep it shut.The first thing I noticed was the squeaky clean on my hair which I really liked, but then after rinsing I felt the big tangled mess.  In order to try the product by itself, I put some conditioner in only half of my hair, rinse, and towel dry.  My hair was really tangled (shampoo only) but I worked everything until I could run a comb through it. Once the hair was dry, I noticed the extra frizz/static.  The hair seemed like it'd been stripped off all natural oils and now it was super clean but with not much of a shine or moisture.I will continue to use this shampoo once a week but I don't think I'll be buying it.  It seems to be a good cleanser but not intended to be used very often or without a conditioner."	"clean hair but no moisture"	"neutral"
"I bought this because I freaked out when I started losing a lot of hair in the shower. Granted, I'm only in my mid-20s but this was recommended to me by a co-worker. The product, along with the shampoo, severely dried out my hair and caused more to fall out. My hair was weaker and easily broke. The smell isn't too bad (it smells minty) but it's hard to sleep and work smelling of mint 24/7. Worst of all, the bottle came half-empty/half-full. Thankfully, Amazon's customer service was responsive as usual."	"Dries Hair"	"bad"
"I am very surprised at how much I like this cleanser. Like most people, I have tried several brands, from high end products to drug store bottles, most recently the Proactive line. I wanted to try something a little less expensive so I thought I'd give this a try. Wow! I love this product. It is very creamy, but has just a bit of foam when you massage it into your skin. You only need about a quarter's worth as a little goes a long way. If it doesn't rinse off easily, cut back on the amount and it will rinse clean. My skin has a much smoother appearance, pores look smaller, and it does not feel stripped or too tight, but very clean. I also like the cap. (snaps to open and close so it always keeps clean) I am going to stay with this product because it is less expensive than others I've used and I've had better results with this one. It's nice to have this affordable luxury."	"Works great if you have large pores or an oily complexion"	"good"
"The weight of this item isn't any different from the others I've used. Slightly heavier than my Healthy Infusions by Wahl Pro Dryer it my opinion. Seems nothing special.I don't like the long nozzle. Perhaps if you have very long limbs, you wouldn't have as much trouble drying the top and top rear potions of your head.The wind output is pretty good, though. Comparable to my Healthy Infusions by Wahl Pro Dryer, it's about the same.No swivel cord. Buttons feel a bit cheap, but I guess it's a hair dryer... nothing fancy here.No, it's not quiet. It's as noisy as my other dryers.It doesn't seem to remove frizzes any better than my other dryers either.All in all, nothing special here. Just another dryer. I'd not pay a premium for it."

"I have never received received the product from the seller here. Then I went and bought it from CVS. I used it twice then my face started to break out. At first I thought it's the cleanser it came it...I let me skin recover for 2 weeks then I used the brush again with my face wash I have been using for months very successfully. My skin broke out again and this time worse than before. So I figure out it's the brush. Maybe the bristles are too harsh or there is something in them that breaks out my skin. Once I stopped using it, my skin recovered and went back to normal. Now I do not have a sensitive skin at all and this was the first time a product irritated and broke out my skin this  badly. I won't be purchasing this product, I'd rather stick to scrubbing pads instead which are amazing."	"Gave me breakouts...and my face is not even sensitive type :("	"bad"

"The good news is that this really works- and FAST! You have the added bonus that it's really inexpensive. I bought mine for $2 at Walmart for 7 oz. If you want soft, smooth skin in a hurry, this is the product for you.It's doesn't look or feel like your typical lotion. That may bother some people, but I don't care. It's also got a scent that is a bit plastic smelling. It's sort of like baby lotion, but not. That may also be off-putting for some.The worst news is that it's loaded with chemicals. Preservatives: Methylparaben and TEA. Yuck. No thanks. The active ingredient is glycerine. If you want the same effect, get some glycerine and water and use that. These are commonly found in bath and body products, so if you don't care, go for it."	"This really works"	"neutral"
"I am very disappointed with this stippling brush. After using it only a few times (honestly less than 5) the bristles are falling out. I have watched the tutorials on how to use a stippling brush so I do not believe it is technique or improper use. I have only used it with tinted moisturizer. Each time I did the problem got worse. One of the things that persuaded me to purchase the Real Techniques brushes were the reviews about how the bristles didn't fall out. Today I had several left on my face and upon lightly tugging on the bristles an entire section became dislodged from the handle. I wonder if it is defective because I also purchased several other Real Techniques brushes ( including the foundation brush which gets a lot more of a workout than the stippling) and after weeks of almost daily use they are still in great shape and I absolutely love them.  Sad because I really liked the idea of applying my tinted moisturizer with this brush and being able to add more coverage where I need it with a flawless finish."	"Disappointed"	"bad"

"I owned this dryer already and wanted to get another one because the cap was getting brittle around the edges and was scratchy on my forehead.  The hose also kinked up and wouldn't go back in.  I found that it dried my hair well and left it soft and shiny.  I figured that for the price, it was worth ordering a new one.  The first time that I used it the plastic around the ring that attached to the hose separated, causing an air gap.  I also noticed that this one is ALOT louder than my other one.  At least before I could watch TV, now it's just too loud.  I'm afraid it's going back.  My only dilemma is, which one should I get.  None of them have very good reviews and are either less wattage and/or more expensive.  Unfortunately, I gave away my old one when this one arrived."	"Cheap plastic bonnet....scratchy"	"neutral"

So I went home and applied it immediately after cleansing my face and putting on a primer. Than I noticed how DEAD I looked. More so than usual. I am Porcelain in a lot of shades but this one looked like I was from outer space. I can honestly say my face looked green. I than put it on my hand and I looked at it and I couldn't believe how green tinted it was, perhaps I got a malfunction bottle but It was so odd.Pros --Long Lasting (with use of primer)Cons --VERY oily, I was like a oily alien when I wore this and I have DRY skin-I looked like a green alien.Sigh.

I wouldn't classify my skin as sensitive but salicylic acid in my experience is a pretty harsh ingredient and has a tendency to sometimes irritate my skin.This product, much to my surprise, did not irritate my skin at all. In fact, after using this product a few times I found my skin to look noticeably fresher and healthier. This scrub also seems to be working its magic on my acne issues. My acne isn't completely eliminated but I've noticed the occurrence of new acne is far less frequent since I've been using this scrub.

The pigmentation was NOT good, after a few hours it travels and disappears. I have dry skin, so traveling makeup should NOT be an issue, but this was. The only way I could get it to stay was to put cream blush on underneath and layer it over it, which of course changes the color. Shouldn't have to do that for the hefty price, IMO.

I think this would be a great lotion for fair skinned people or someone who wants a beginner bronzer to speed things up. Designer Skin bronzers are just way too light for my taste.

"I have very long eyelashes and wanted something that was going to make them look even longer. The problem with my lashes are that though they're long; they're very thin. So I wanted them to look fuller as well. Looking up what I could do without having to weigh between buying expensive and unsure growth serums, or get impossible results that could happen right away - I turned to mascara (I never use to wear any). A distant acquaintance recommended me this product, and I immediately stepped on board upon admiring her eyelashes that were absolutely so stunning that she could do make up commercials herself.I spent almost $20.00 on this little tube, and it was a most horrible decision. It made my eyelashes look just as thin, and it took a long time for it to harden so my lashes could keep its shape. It didn't make them look any better. The brush/ball itself had small plastic bristles, and it looked like there wasn't enough product going on the brush... which is suppose to be the point of mascara. It would also clump horrendously on the ball. I found this to be very unimpressive. The shipping was very fast, and it got to me okay. I just can't say anything positive about this product. Overall, if you want fantastic mascara for good pricing, length, and volume: Maybelline Lash Stiletto."	"Not what I expected..."	"bad"

"At first glance this stuff is awful. When you squeeze it out it feels like nothing you want to slather into your hair. ESPECIALLY not into your scalp. But that is the whole premise of this line. Healthy scalp and roots, healthy hair. So when I felt this nasty, thick concoction I pretty gingerly massaged it into my scalp and the rest of my hair. I don't know if you're not supposed to put it on the rest of your hair, or what, because afterward while my hair was drying while I was getting dressed, my hair started to feel so dried out and it started to get that crunchy feeling. I hated it. I was done with this Clear line.But when I blow dried my hair, I instantly noticed that my roots had volume. I was impressed. I actually had some lift to the crown of my head and I really liked it.I tried the shampoo and the conditioner again, (I know it is a treatment mask, but my hair is dried out enough that I can use treatment masks as a daily conditioner) and it gave me the same results. It looked nasty, it felt nasty, and it caused my hair to feel nasty, yet upon blow drying it gave me a lift.While I really liked the volume it gave my roots, it is not enough to get over how much I dislike using this product. The conditioner is really not like anything I have ever used before. The consistency of the conditioner is so nasty. It feels like paste and I hated it upon contact. The thought of smearing it into my scalp was not pleasant and it left my hair feeling dried out and crunchy. The only thing that saved me was my favorite Holy Grail Macadamia Nut Healing Oil spray.So while I appreciate the lift, I do not think I will ever repurchase this product. Thanks."

"Amazon merged all four of my reviews on the four different Axe Face Washes so I will give feedback on all three here:CONTROIL (yellow): **** (four stars) I used this today and my face is already very noticably smoother. With all the weather we've been having I've been dealing with a very dry complexion that lotion just wasn't working. I also like that it has a fruity fragrance as well. (I do wonder why Axe doesn't have lines of smells so that you aren't mixing this fruity smell with their cologne-y deoderant and face washes and hair products.) I really like this. So why only 4 stars? The price. Similar products run you a couple bucks less and work as well. (This is an issue with Axe products.)CHILL (blue): * (one star) I tried this for several days and was very unhappy with it. It smells awful and the only \"chill\" part of it was the menthol after it kicked in. It works, but why would you get one that smells this terrible when the other two are so much better for the same price?ENERGIZING (orange): *** (three stars) I like this one OK. I found that it worked well for a stand alone clean (like when I just need a quick wash at the sink.) It has some scrubbing beads but not a lot and it wasn't sticky and cleaned off well. I don't know why it is called energizing as it didn't tingle or cool or anything. It was very mild, which I liked.SHIELD (white): **** (four stars) This is an extremely mild foaming wash that I found was great for my sensitive skin. (Even though I like the others, I will sometime sbreak out with a mild, quickly vanishing rash with those and pretty much all soaps). The pump works well in the shower and I ended up washing and shaving with this same soap.For my money, I'd but the yellow CONTROIL or SHIELD. If you don't like the scrubbing beads then go with white SHIELD or orange ENERGIZING depending on if you have sensitive skin or not. Run away from the blue CHILL. It's terrible."

"I bought this after reading the review by the woman in her 30's saying it didn't dry out her skin ect.  For me, this product was useless in clearing up acne.  I broke out the entire time I used it.  The cleanser & astringent aren't enough.  I used them up over a month ago & have maybe a 1/4 of the cream left.  The only good thing it seemed to do was help to exfoliate my skin keeping away the dry winter flakes that are included with my acne.  Crazy, but that's me.  Salicylic Acid isn't rated as being too safe if you are pregnate or want to have kids... hardly Organic!!  I didn't know this until after I was using it.  I will finish it up so it doesn't go to waste but will not purchase in the future."	"Not drying but didn't clear up acne"	"bad"

My nose is not grotesquely large but I would have liked if the strip could come over the tip of my nose and slightly onto my cheeks so that it could cover the sides of my nostrils completely.

"First off, the machine is great.  I have had this product for about a month now and the machine works well.  I set it to medium flow and use about 8 drops of the lighest color and I get a very good, even coverage that really is flawless except for two issues.1.  I can not spray it under the eyes because I actually get it IN my eyes, so I have to use a seperate makeup around the eyes which I personally do not mind so much.  Maybe that technique comes with time, not sure.2.  The makeup itself is awful, well for me anyway.  I would compare this makeup to the all day wear makeups that dry on your skin and make it feel like your wearing a mask.  Revlon Colorstay is a good example, its heavy makeup and feels uncomfortable to me.I wonder if anybody has found a different (lighter weight) makeup to use with the machine?Pros:1.  Machine and concept work great.2.  Moisturizer that comes with the machine makes the makeup look even better, if thats possible.3.  Time saver, if you keep this machine set up and ready to go then it only takes a minute to do your entire face and clean up is short and easy.4.  Really has great coverage, no smears, no smudges and you really do get that flawless, even coverage look.Cons:1.  The makeup that comes with the machine is heavy and wears like a mask, some women like this... I do not.  I prefer a Lancome Photogenic style of makeup, one that stays on but is light weight and flexible.2.  Keeping this makeup out of your eyes can be a challenge, even on the low setting which in my opinion wastes makeup.3.  Expensive, though cheaper than most of the other systems it is still pricey."

As soon as I got it I read the directions and did a 30 second test.. Didn't feel anything. So a few hours later I put it back on for about 2 minutes. Didn't notice or feel anything. The next day I put a layer on for one minute and a second layer on for about 5 minutes. I felt it sting a bit and washed it off. Its been a few days and I can notice a difference today. I still have a few patches of lightly peeling skin. But my skin looks more even toned and my brown spots are lighter. I love this stuff..

"This is a very thick BB cream, medium coverage, a bit difficult to blend, a very light natural sweet fragrance,  soft and doesn't clog my pores, a light shade with yellow undertones but a cool hue. You will need a powder in your skin tone to even out any numbing hues. I got a free sample of etude house nymph aura volumer, blended it with this BB and it made it a tad better and hydrating.I also got a sample of the Lioele beyond the solution, it was actually pretty good and what I may try next!

And I have been using this twice a day and still no side effects.Now I am only 27 and don't have any wrinkles, but I still wanted to try this product to PREVENT anything from ocurring or at least just make my skin look better (you can never have too much of that). It's hard to tell if there is a change in my skin.  It just might be too soon for me to notice anything yet.Fingers crossed that it will only get better! But at least I have no bad results at all.

Yet, I have not observed any effects beafter 5 weeks of diligent use (every night smeered on the eyelids, let it dry, then applied a moisturaizer for eyelids - the green gel purchased at Ulta).

"This review is not about the product itself but the condition of the product when it was received. I bought this on Amazon thanks to the great reviews but my advice- GET IT SOMEWHERE ELSE . When i received the powder, it was so broken i couldnt even see the original pattern . It had completely blended together to the point it looked like cocoa powder. I sent an email and all i wanted was a new one but the company offered to pay me my money back just to keep it. Which is fine and all but I wanted the powder! And I wanted the powder how I originally ordered it. I am very fair skinned so when it mixed together it does nothing for me. What am I going to do with it except throw it away ?

I've used it a couple of times now and my hair is always a bit dryer than normal after I wash it. I think it could be more moisturizing. However, it is a better shampoo than some of the other ones that I have tried. It lathers well, and I like the scent, plus a little goes a very long way. Still in search of a better shampoo though."

"I was looking for a daily moisturizer that would actually moisturize my face, so when I saw Hope in a Jar on QVC, I had to buy it. I have tried the product for two weeks now, and, all I have gotten is the same result. I have only put a pea-sized drop of this stuff on each and every night, and, when I wake up, I wake up to a cluster of blackheads and zits, usually on either my nose or my forehead. I am also very allergic to a lot of chemicals in beauty products, but this was the worst! I actually have to be put on steroids for 30 days because it is making my asthma and high IGE levels of allergies act up badly. Also, if you have oily skin, BEWARE. I don't have oily skin, and this made me break out in tons of zits, so, imagine what it would do to people that have really oily or oily skin!

In my opinion they are great for the price and also that the designs are big enough to cover an average size nail. I do recommend buying this set."	"love it"	"good"
"I thought this would be a nice for my 19-year old daughter have before she went back to school.

I don't have any idea about these kinds of things.I was mistaken.All of these hair styling devices don't work the same.  I didn't know that.  She and her mom told me that her hair is too thick and the brush's bristles are too soft.  \"Perhaps if the brush had harder bristles, maybe\"But, they liked the fact that it was solidly built and had the weight of a good blow-dryer but it was not designed for women of color and/or women who have thicker, weighted hair.Her mom suggested that maybe if a woman had her hair permed or \"straightened\"--to use a cultural vernacular--then this could work.

"I've used Olay Regenerist's undereye roller for about a month. Olay says that \"instantly puffiness is reduced, the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles is softened, and skin's appearance will be beautifully regenerated\". I have to say when I use the undereye roller that instantly puffiness is reduced and my eyes do look better. I think the results are only temporary though. I think the rolling motion is the real reason that the puffiness is reduced, dispersing any fluid in the eye area. I think the lotion that comes out of the roller tightens the area, therefore making wrinkles less noticeable.I do think the roller works but again only for temporary results like most other facial and eye treatments that I have used. If you have trouble with undereye puffiness then I think you will really like this roller, if you are having trouble with fine lines then I recommend theOlay Regenerist Eye Serum (.5 Ounces)."

"I have been using this product for one month, twice a day.  I have not noticed anything different about the coloration of the areas that I have been applying it to.  I do notice that my skin is smoother, but I do hope some of my discolorations go away.  At the beginning of the summer I spent an entire day at the beach, and got a nice raccoon mask tan.  Of course I had high SPF sunscreen and a big hat on, but all of that reflective sunlight just trumps all of that.I have medium olive-toned Asian skin.  This product may be different for different skin types and ethnicities.  I am unsure of what the main active ingredient is in this product, but on the box it says that \"this concentrated treatment hydrates to improve overall skin for more even skin tone while micro exfoliation helps remove dullness for brighter skin\".  One of the first ingredients is Niacinamide, which is vitamin B-3.  I don't know what it is supposed to do for skin improvement.This product comes packaged in a plastic bottle with a dropper.  It's nice because it is easy to get a small amount of product without wasting it.  Many times with a pump dispenser, too much product comes out.  The amount of product in this 1.3 ounce bottle should last a while, as you don't need a lot of it unless you are applying it to your entire face.  I am concentrating on the upper part of my cheeks, which is a contained triangular area that points down to my laugh lines.  I don't know when I can expect to see visible results, I will edit my review if I begin to notice changes in the coming weeks."	"Not sure when I'm supposed to start seeing results"	"neutral"
"I cannot comment on the overall effectiveness of this product, because I didn't make it that far. When I applied the mask to my face, I instantly became nauseous due to the wretched smell of this stuff. It literally smelled like a diaper pail. I had to take it off right away because the smell was so horrid, and I washed my face three times afterwards until I couldn't smell the foul odor anymore. It's possible I got a bad batch, but I don't plan on shelling out another $69 to find out."	"Horrible!"	"bad"
"Fairly sheer, slightly moisturizing for normal/oily skin. Good price vs, Skinceuticals brand. I will continue to use this for a few months and will update when I have more time to asses how well it protects my skin. I really miss my Skinceuticals spf 45, which has been discontinued and was more 'matte' in terms of sheen, hence the 4-star rating, not 5. Why must they always ruin a good thing for me?!!!"

"I've been using Olay moisturizers for years and have been very happy with them.  They are consistently good for the price.  This one is about half the price of what I normally pay for the Olay product that I've used for years.  I actually got this for my mother who complains about dry facial skin all of the time.  She's older, and using Olay daily lotion, but after reading the description I thought that maybe this might be good for her to put on at night.  For her it didn't seem to make any difference, so I decided to try it.I used it at night, since it says you'll wake up with refreshed skin.  I thought it felt a bit sticky going on and took longer to absorb than the other lotions that I use.  After it dried I did feel that my skin was a bit tight, almost like it was a very thin mask on my skin.  I don't know if I used to much or what, either way I didn't really feel like it did much for me either.Clearly I think this is marketed to younger women (teens-twenties) who are looking for a product that is a light moisturizer that won't make your skin breakout and will hydrate it a bit.  It's packaging, marketing and pricing are geared towards this market...of which I am not one, LOL.  I like Olay products, but I think that the Olay Fresh Effects Dew Over is only for fresh faced lovelies that are under 25 :)"	"Sticky & Not As Mosturizing as other Olay products"	"neutral"

"I have always thought the decanter holding the precious liquid was pretty but I was unprepared how gorgeous and mesmerizing this scent was going to be. From the moment I rubbed the tester from a magazine my nose was in love. Five minutes later I ordered a big bottle off the internet and it arrived a few days ago, and I still cannot part with the scent. I even spray it on to go to bed, the sheer fact how warm and softly scented my sheets are in the morning makes it hard to get up to work. This scent melts into the skin, the musky cr&egrave;me brulee base is topped with juicy crimson watermelon, glowing mandarin, apples, fresh aquatic hyacinth, royal smelling lily and precious woods that give it a soft and spun like quality to the scent. I often find myself inhaling the aroma through the day, catching whiffs of my warm body and they escape up and away.This fragrance is truly delectable with a softly scented melange of fruit and musky vanillas that really smells delicious and not like a fruit cake that so often is the result of perfumers going on a sugar coated overload. The scent is almost an aphrodisiac, a meteor shower raining down the inky sky with fluorescent flavors. This is my favorite new fragrance along with Estee Lauder's Beyond Paradise and I wear it from morning after my shower until the stars spear the sky and I lull myself to sleep. It's breathtakingly beautiful and so fragrant that my nose might never get over it, no wonder this perfume is so hard to find!Notes: Watermelon, Mandarin, Pink Passion Fruit, Marigold, Green Apple, Water Hyacinth, Crushed Leaves, Tuberose Absolute, Wild Rose, Princess Lily, Tuberose, Caramel Creme Brulee, Vanilla, Precious Woods, Patchouli.- Kasia S."

My oily skin still gets flaky and has dry patches in the winter, and this moisturizer takes care of that problem immediately. In the morning, my skin is smooth and flake free. I only use this at night because for my skin it is a bit heavy for use under make-up. Perhaps someone with very dry skin can use it under make-up as well.

"What is it?Dove Men+Care Hydrate + Shave Gel is a shaving gel specially formulated to tend to dry skin and help alleviate irritation associated with shaving dry skin.Why do I need this?Um, why else do you need all shaving gels and creams? So you know where you've already shaved. However, for this certain product, it claims to be specially made for people who have dry and easily irritated skin.What's in the tube?It's your average shaving gel can, coming in at 7 ounces.How does it feel?It's a gel alright. I will say that it comes out of the dispenser a little more foamy than other shaving gels. So you really don't have to put much effort into it to lather it up. A little bit goes a long way as it spreads easily.How does my skin feel after using this product?So here comes the difficulty in rating this product, my morning routine. I have a morning routine that involves washing my face before I shave. I've been doing this for about 20 years or more, as spoken from the noble Prince of Fresh...\"If it ain't broke, then why try and fix it...SUMMER SUMMERTIME\" Ironically enough, I've been using Dove facial soap for most of those years. So can I honestly tell you if it feels smoother than it did before? No, I noticed no real difference after using this product. Again, I know I can't be alone in having a morning routine, and shaving can't be the first or last thing on the routine, but always in the middle.How does it smell?Like shaving gel. Sorry bacon lovers, it looks as if you'll have to wait another year for bacon-scented shaving gel.Is there anything better?Yes, but The Art of Shaving website is kind of expensive for my tastes. So let's stick to supermarket and drugstore brands. For a man who has been shaving his head for over 10 years, I have found that if you have irritated skin, the key ingredient you want to look for in your shaving gel or cream has to be shea butter. Also, you could look into aloe vera, but it's hard to impossible to find a shaving gel with those two ingredients. However, Gillette Fusion ProGlide has shea butter, and I've found it cheaper than Dove's option. Again, anything more than that, and you're looking at salon or specialty shops.For the money, is it worth it?So going back to what I said previously about morning routines...because of my morning routine, any effects provided by this shaving gel are either added upon or taken away from because of my routine. So it's really hard to say if the cost of this product is justified by the benefits it provides when I'm not really certain of the benefits it provides. Do I have the facial hair removed? Yes. Is my skin soft-ish? Yes. Do I get the occasional ingrown hair or shaving bump? Yes, but, that could be more or less attributed to the razor blade getting dull. So really, it's hard to tell if this product is worth the price. I'm going to say if you stop by the store, and you see it at a club card price or at Costco, and you can get a case where the price per unit is decent, go for it.Will I get this product again?Again, unless it's on sale, most likely not. I'm going to stick with the Gillette Fusion ProGlide with shea butter. Honestly, I really don't see a difference, as I think a lot of the factors of skin care rely on the quality of the razor, and the other skin care regiment."

"This is a great, inexpensive foundation. It covers well but is not heavy.  The makeup will last all day on me, and lasts even through an aerobic workout.  It does not rub off easily, and you will need a good cleanser to clean your face of this foundation.  The foundation has several shades to pick from, and I found a shade that blends with my skin tone very well. I use a damp sponge to put on the foundation and blend it in.  The make up is very natural looking, evens out my skin tone, covers well but sits lightly on my face.  I have bought this make up several times, and will probably continue to buy it.  I would recommend this make up as good, long lasting coverage that is not heavy."	"Great foundation!"	"good"
"This is a nice color but it doesn't go on evenly or smoothly like the Gelish brand. It's fine enough for a base coat under a glitter coat but I don't think you could get away with any less than 3 coats if you're using it just for a solid color."	"Okay but not great"	"neutral"

I use it once a week as recommended by the container.

One thing I did notice, as with some other Gelish colors, is that it &#34;runs&#34; so I can only do about two nails at a time.  If I do all four or five nails, the first two look horrible due to the color migrating away from the cuticle.  Once I painted two at a time, with some minor touchups at the very end of painting all ten, it looked great.  I had no problems with the wear."	"Great color...."	"good"

When sniffing the product in the tube the scent is strong, but barely detectable once applied to the hair. In my case, that was a positive, though I could see someone who wanted a pronounced scent being disappointed. As other reviewers have mentioned, it does what it intents to do and well. It held a style well and without looking heavy, crunchy or shiny. Even better, it made for hair that still looked great the next day, which is uncommon with most styling products.

"Like many of you, I dove right into the Pinterest craze of sock buns and home decor.Considering myself to be adept at traditional ballet buns (i.e. lots of bobby pins), I loved the perfect bun I could (occasionally) achieve with the sock technique.The problem is that not all socks are the same.  When I lost my &#34;magic&#34; sock, I found this guy-- the Soft 'N Style Hair Donut Black.  I think it might be even better.  Unlike the socks (magic or otherwise), this thing actually grips your hair.  I should mention that I have fine, straight hair that can be on the slippery side.  Also I feel like I can get a much tighter bun with the donut, and so far it hasn't stretched out at all.To use:  pull dry hair into a pony tail, feed tail through middle of donut, slide donut toward end of the tail (leaving a couple of inches), wrap the ends around one side of the donut, and begin simultaneously rolling down and stuffing your hair under.  Your hair will typically spread itself around the donut on it's own as you roll/stuff.  Works like a charm!"	"Even better than a sock!"	"good"

"This stuff is surely not made for anyone who has to wash their hands numerous times during a day. I am an RN, in an ICU and I brought this to work with me to get a number of opinions. We all came to the same conclusions: It is a little greasy going on; absorbs pretty well but leaves a sticky feeling for a short while; It doesn't last through the first handwashing after you've used it; great scent and package.All in all, I would recommend this for home use only for the above stated reasons."

"Sorry, I wish I could rate this higher.My skin is combination, sensitive and acne-prone.  After reading so many great reviews of this soap, I took a chance - I mean, for the price, why not?  I used this for 3-4 months and I liked it quite a bit when I started using it.  My skin felt really clean and refreshed, but over time, I noticed my skin drying and it started to burn (no, I did not start using a new beauty product).Gave this a 3-star rating due to how my skin reacted.  However, it did clear up some of my acne and my face felt really cleansed.  This soap did not damage my skin, so it went back to normal after I stopped using it on my face. I use it on the rest of my body and I don't have the same reaction I did when it was on my face.  Go ahead and try it if your curious. The price is great and others really seem to benefit, so it could work for you."	"Irritated & dried my sensitive skin"	"neutral"

"OMG this stuff works and is fantastic just after one use!!! I read about this product online and decided to order & give it a try because I have fine hair that is damaged so I needed something strong that will help repair it. I used this for the first time yesterday and WOW....Love, love, love it!! I can tell it immediately strengthen my hair and made it feel 100 xs stronger, fuller with LOTS of body and less prone to breakage once I rinsed and roller set. The results exceeded my expectations. This is by far hands down the best protein treatment I have ever used. I think it works better than aphogee's and Dudley's DRC protein treatment in my opinion and those both cost MORE than this one so go figure!! I was using aphogee but that has now been replaced with this!! I will continue to use this weekly because my hair loves protein. I did follow up with a good moisturizing conditioner afterwards to balance it out. My hair came out strong and healthy looking after. My hair is fine and relaxed so this will definitely be a sample for me. It's the best kept secret treatment for brittle and/or damaged hair. Highly recommend it for people with fine hair that is breaking and/or damaged due to relaxing and/or coloring. Like everyone said it's really expensive here so I didn't order this from Amazon bc its less expensive at the site the last customer put up (thanks for that btw) bc the shipping on Amazon for this is ridiculous!!! This product is definitely the TRUTH!!!!"	"Wonderful Product for damaged and/or Fine Hair"	"good"

"Had I never tried other tanning products, I'd probably rate this a four or five because it does impart a nice glow to skin. However, for a &#34;Medium/Dark&#34; tanning product, I'd say it should be labeled as &#34;Medium&#34; at best. For people with very pale skin, this product would probably work well as it doesn't make your skin dark, and therefore you wouldn't have to worry about streaks. The spray is a little tough to get a hang of. Too close and you're really just making streaks on your skin that you have to blend out, and that drip. Too far and the product just fills the air and barely does anything to your skin. I resorted to using it close and then blending with a mit. The tan that I got out of this was, for lack of a better word, translucent. In a dim room, I looked tan. In natural light, you could tell I had put a tanning spray over light skin. I'm an experienced tanner and sunless tanner. I exfoliate, use a mit, and can usually achieve a very even tan with any product. The results of this product were darker than Fake Bake, but I'd still use Fake Bake over this because it is easier, dries faster, and is much more even. My new favorite for a truly dark tan is St Moriz mousse in dark. Nothing beats it.Suggestions for use- the first time I used this, I used one spray down each limb. It wasn't dark at all. The second time, I sprayed up close and covered my limbs. It was a little darker, but once I showered, most of the tan was gone and it was still not a solid looking tan in natural light. If you're using this, use a lot!Overall- I won't throw this out. Maybe I'll use it as a backup. It would work to use if you're very pale and want to go out in a bathing suit, perhaps to darken your tan, but don't want to go out looking pale."	"Not very dark, not the most even"	"neutral"

"One of the annoying things that I've discovered about growing older is that things that should have been left in my past - like acne - not only stick around but sometimes get worse. Such is life.I don't have excessive acne, but I do battle breakouts on occasion, and my skin would never be described as clear and healthy. I've tried various products to alleviate acne. Most of them work somewhat but none of them has ever done the job consistently.I used the Clearasil Ultra Daily Face Wash for a couple of weeks on a trial basis. Here's my experience:I like the tube and cap design of the package. It's easy to store and easy to use. I also like the scent of this product. It has a light, pleasant scent that doesn't leave me smelling like I just took a bath in perfume. Best of all, the scent isn't girlie; my husband can use this wash.The consistency of this wash is odd and a bit off-putting. It's thick and has an almost mucous feel to it. It lathers on the skin ok, but then it takes forever to rinse off. I think I have to rinse my face for nearly five minutes to get all traces of this off my skin. I learned to be very careful and tie back my hair before using this because if I get it in my hair, it takes a while to rinse out.I find that my skin is quite smooth and soft after I use this. I like that. I was afraid that this wash would dry out my face (most products do). I don't see any increase in dryness, although my face often feels tight. I also find that some of my trouble areas (creases around my nose) are clearer after using this. Unfortunately, I also started getting some really large pimples in places on my face where I've never had them before. Pimples that take days to go away. It's such an odd experience to have a product that is supposed to help control the acne actually make the acne worse. I don't know if it's the consistency of the wash. Perhaps even with all the rinsing I'm still not removing all of it from my skin? I'm not sure, but after a couple of weeks, I've gone back to my old face cleansing routine.I think a tried and true rule applies to this product - some people will try it and love and some will try it with little or no success. It doesn't work for me."	"Washes the face but doesn't get rid of acne"	"neutral"
"Recently I learned a phrase - my hair has a wrinkle. Gosh, what are the teenage girls up to nowadays.Well, everyone seems to have a straightener.When my hair actually got a real wrinkle when I left certain part of it grow and pulled together for too long, it, yeah, had a wrinkle, this tool took less than 2 minutes to straighten it out.So how about some fancy curls? No luck. My hair got caught in the connecting parts many times, so I lost a few. And the side of the straightener gets very hot to handle correctly. The temperature dial is miserable."

"I've used the Nexxus spray leave-in conditionerNexxus Dualiste Color Protection Plus Intense Hydration, Leavein Conditioning Spray, 7.5 Fluid Ouncefor years as a detangler more than for the conditioner. Two light sprays works perfectly, anymore and my hair (fine, below the shoulder, highlighted) is weighed down and limp. So I was intrigued to try this new Nexxus leave-in conditioner purporting to be \"weightless\".The pump design delivers measured amounts perfectly. One for dry hair, provides a quick texture pick-me-up. The recommended two pumps for damp hair is exactly right for my rather standard head of hair. It doesn't work as a detangler and isn't meant to, but does exactly what it claims as a conditioner.It provides weightless volume without the typical feathered, or frizzy affect so typical with volume-enhancing products. My hair feels healthy, and strong with no fly-a-ways, making blow-drying and styling a breeze. Also, provides a natural silky shine. Importantly, after daily use, there is no build-up. Thus, there is no need to buy additional shampoo products to remove built-up conditioning product. This is an excellent new product from Nexxus, a little pricey, so hopefully Amazon can work a deal with Nexxus for a more reasonable price point."

"I received this trial product through the Vine Program as was curious if it would make a difference to my hair using curling Iron, blow dying my hair and playing golf in the summer sun. I have not noticed too much difference as at my age of 87 I still have lots of hair and wanted to protect it in some way.  I found using the spray nozzle was uncomfortable to use I seemed to be spraying into the air some of the time.  My thumb would slip off and would try it with one finger.  I could give my hair the mist but used too much the first time.  My hair sort of clumpped together if that is a word.  It looked like it needed another washing so used a smaller amount after that.  It is not something I though made too much of a difference and so eased up on using the curling iron and only partially blow dry my hair.  That seemed to be the answer so am hoping it will work this summer when playing golf in the sun.  That is when I need the protection so give this product a try and use it in ways that helps preserve your hair for a long tme."	"Spray to Protect"	"neutral"
"I am so displeased with this product that I am earnestly baffled that it has any positive reviews.First, it's huge and more than half the size is the plastic frame part. The mirror itself is small, smaller than an average hand mirror. Worse, the plastic isn't nice plastic. It looks ugly and it doesn't feel sturdy.Mine also has a message *printed* into the plastic that says \"Rotate mirror up to close side panels\" - only this model doesn't actually have side panels. That screams cheap to me. Like the company used leftover parts to make this.There is a little slider that is supposed to change the light for day, office, home, etc. But just moves a colored film in front of the light bulbs. Not helpful at all. The \"office\" one is particularly bad, because the film is blue-green. No office looks like that. Perhaps if they called it \"aquarium\"...The slider and films also feel flimsy and rickety; the sliding motion isn't smooth.The mirror has a 5x side, you can rotate it so that side is facing front. But, like most magnifying mirrors, you have to be in the exact right spot to get a clear picture. Unfortunately, that spot is about 1 inch away from the mirror... which means the light bulbs are right next to you, shining in your eyes and not lighting your face evenly.The lights are really bright. Other than that, this product has no positive features. I'd rather use ANY other mirror in my house than this one."	"ugly and cheaply made"	"bad"

"The positives of this product:It's not greasy.It's lightweight and seems to absorb in the skin quickly.It comes in an attractive container, or is nicely packaged.It's reasonably priced. You get 18oz for $6.And the Suave brand is one that is traditionally reliable and trustworthy. I have used several of their products over the years and been satisfied.The drawbacks of this product:Moroccan Argan oil or Maroccanoil is all the rage these days (it's like shea butter, it's infused in almost everything). However,I don't think that it added much to the scent or the feel of this product. Of course the benefits of having a product that contains this oil isn't necessarily about the smell but the benefits to the skin (moisturize, sooth etc). But I was expecting a little more regarding the smell. Something more calming, and somewhat soothing. Don't get me wrong, it has a scent that isn't a strong or overwhelming scent (to me), but it doesn't exactly knock your socks off as a wonderful one. It's just ok. And initially, I found myself smelling my hands and arms constantly, trying to place the scent because it kind of nagged at me.And if your skin is really dry, I am not sure if this product would be the best thing for you. While it does moisturize some, it didn't necessarily provide the best coverage with one application. Some, for example those with really dry skin, would not necessarily like the fact that it is so lightweight (not creamy but a little on the thin side). To me, it doesn't seem, to offer the kind of protection that I need, hence the 3.5 stars. Don't get me wrong, it isn't awful, but I prefer a heavier lotion (like Nivea, Eucerin, Keri or L'Occitane Hand Lotion),on that gives me more moisture with better coverage. But never fear, I plan to put this bottle of lotion in my teenage boy's bathroom or my guest restroom for them to use."	"Just ok. 3.5 stars"	"neutral"

"Old Spice and I go way back.  I have used it since I was a teenager, (yes a teenager, I never did care about being cool), and I still use it many decades later.  I have also used their deodorant in one form or another over the years.  To be honest though, I have never cared for any kind of body wash, including that of Old Spice.  (Just an old fashioned guy that prefers bar soap that has been around for hundreds of years).  Though I can't compare this soap to its body wash equivalent, I feel the strength and scent of it is just fine for me.  Yes it could be a little stronger as so many here have mentioned, but it's neither weak nor non existent either.  It has a nice comfy shape, lathers up very well, and I feel very refreshed after using it and can smell the scent for some time afterwards. In short, if you're someone that enjoys a real overpowering soap, you may be disappointed in this despite its lather and freshness. On the other hand, real old time Old Spice fans like myself will not notice that all too much, nor care.  (Old Spice was never one of those overpowering colognes anyway). The price for it here on Amazon is very reasonable and I recommended for its lather, shape, and freshness... : )"	"Great For True Old Spice Fans"	"good"

After awhile, my hair softened up and when I showered later, it was more elastic and strong.

"I used to do microdermabrasion at one of these fairly no-name salons in NYC.  It wasn't too expensive and I liked the results - my face felt smoother and less patchy, and there was a substantial reduction in blackheads.I stopped going for microdermabrasion when I got pregnant and my skin got very sensitive.  After the baby was born, going to the salon was the last of my concerns.But I received this Nu Brilliance system and tried it out.  I have to say it's really not that unlike the treatments I had in NYC.  Neither one irritated me too much - so I think the people getting irritated would also be irritated by salon treatment.  Maybe they weren't sure what they were getting into.  If you have a bad reaction to microderm in general, the problem is that it's not a good solution for your skin type - nothing specific to this machine.Anyway, during pregnancy I got some dark patches of skin on my face.  Nothing major.  And it seems like after a month of treatment with this product, they have lightened.  And I know that's supposed to happen post pregnancy anyway, but they didn't budge in the first month after the baby was born - nothing changed until I started using this.  So I'm actually somewhat of a believer.  At the very least, I do have the same blackhead reduction and smoother skin I got from salon treatments.Anyway, that's my review.  This is an ok machine and I think if you are familiar and comfortable with salon treatments, this is a decent solution too.  I can't vouch for how long it will last, but it should pay for itself before it breaks down.  Not that I think it will.  After a month of use, I have no issues."	"Pregnancy dark patches"	"good"
"When I got this, it looked ok.  There was nothing visibly wrong with the shipping package or the item itself.  I just could not get the pump to work.  It has a arrow on it, to unscrew it a bit, and I've sued a lot of pump products like this, but this one just would not work. Then, creme conditioner started leaked out the top.  So I had a pump top locked in place, and conditioner oozing out of the top.  The only way i could use it was to just unscrew it and try to use the end of the pump to dip some out.It smells nice.  It's a sweet fragrance but it is fairly light, and it disappeared once my hair was dry.  It left my hair soft and smooth, and feeling hydrated.  It didn't accentuate my waves, but it didn't way them down and completely out either, and I think I probably used a bit more than I normally would.The bottle is fairly small, but this is really nice stuff- the leave in conditioner- to put on the ends of long hair, even if you don't wash all of your hair. Sometimes I might just get my ends wet without washing my very long hair, and put a bit of conditioner on the ends.  It helps, especially in winter where our heat is so drying."

"I bought this on Amazon for 29.99. I had high hopes for this product as I have been a loyal and happy consumer of Conair products for over 20 years. I am very disappointed with pretty much every aspect of this product. It is cumbersome to use, as it is heavy and awkward. It also gets very hot, even on the lowest temperature. There is nothing protecting the device from your skin, so you have to be very careful not to burn yourself.The straightening feature works well enough, but leaves crimps in your hair if you are a novice. The curling feature is totally cumbersome, and very easy to burn your skin in the process. Even with the correct grip, the curl feature just stinks. I use my loyal conair hot rollers to curl my hair.All in all, a total bomb. Will I use the product: sometimes. Would I buy it again. NO WAY!UPDATE: Two years later I still have this accessible, but never use, I pulled it out last week, and was reminded how cumbersome and impractical this is."	"Burn Baby Burn"	"bad"

"I was on the hunt for a finishing powder that would not settle into fine lines around my eyes after using a concealer.  Although I've used Bare Minerals for many years, I've found that it's a bit dry for my face during the winter, since we moved to West Virginia, where the humidity is low.  Although I'm 52 years old, I still have a lot of oil in my t-zone, especially in the summer, but the skin under my eyes can become a bit dry.  Trying to find a makeup for this unique combination of 50+ year old skin, and oily/dry skin combo has been a challenge.I've had a chance to use this, while it's hot outside, and now with the temperatures dropping (along with the humidity).  It goes on flawless.  It does not accentuate fine lines, but it takes care of the shine in my t-zone.  The Bare Minerals started feeling tight on my face and itching during the winter.  I don't have a problem with Tarte.  Since it's colorless, you really don't see it on the face.  It takes a very small amount; just a light dusting does the job.I've put it on, then used a 15x LED lighted mirror later in the day to check the performance of Tarte Smooth Operator, and I'm impressed.  Even after several hours my makeup is in place, and not settled into fine lines."	"Finally, a Finishing Powder That Works"	"good"
"This flat iron when it arrived I was so excited to use it,liked it the first time I used it but for some reason it did not work so great after a few uses did not have that silky smoothness that I thought it would have."	"not what I thought"	"neutral"
"I've been using this for about 4 weeks now, once a week per the instructions.  I haven't noticed any difference in my hair at all as far as color goes -- it doesn't look lighter or glossier.  Though, this product does make my hair feel very soft.  That's a perk, but not really the intended purpose.  Today, I left it on about 15-20 minutes even to see if that would make a difference (the bottle recommends 3 minutes), but nothing.  Keep looking!"	"Didn't notice any difference"	"bad"
"I am normally 100% devoted to my Revlon Colorstay foundation, but since it was summer time and my skin had gotten a little darker, I thought I'd try this product. I'm so glad that I did! The pump on the bottle is very convenient, (and the fact that it closes is freakin' great!) and I do not need a brush to apply it so I don't mess up too badly on those groggy mornings before 6AM shifts. As for oil control, I did notice a difference, but it was not a complete miracle. I still had to blot my face a couple of times, no biggie. Also, it covers my acne scars and breakouts very well compared to the Colorstay. Overall, I really like this product and I am really considering purchasing a lighter shade this winter."	"!"	"good"
"What I liked about this product is:1) Texture - non greasy, which is rare to find in face cream.2) Pump - I like the distribution method where I pump it into my palm3) Good size and amountThe main thing I didn't like - and this might be just a bad or old batch - was the scent. My product smelled like over due perfume.In terms of how good this product is for my skin - I can't really tell, but on the other hand when can you really tell?"	"Great texture, not sure my skin is better"	"neutral"
"the brushes were not what I expected them to be.  I found the blending shadow brush too long and not thick enough.  Overall, I didn't care for any of the brushes, I am returning this set."	"not worth it, save your money"	"bad"

"I'm reviewing this for the product but have not purchased from Amazon. I get this at the department store. I'm a male, have combination, olive tone skin that isn't sensitive or acne prone.This is a very good, basic cleanser that can be used by anyone. I like the packaging and feel that this is appropriate for male or females. However, this is not worth the money. You'd be better off with Purpose Gentle Cleansing for like $5."

"Products was a disappointment. I've used tar soap in the past for my skin care. This did not work at all. Guess you can't return a half used bar of tar."	"Tar Bar"	"bad"
"If you use this in conjunction with the Frizz Control Clear Shampoo, you will experience good results for the first several washes if your hair is prone to weather-based frizzing. After this, it becomes kind of average in terms of help and you will need to use a serum or similar product to help tame your hair on worse days -- at least I did.This conditioner's consistency is only slightly different than the shampoo which is kind of interesting. It does rinse clean despite this."	"Good complement to the Clear Frizz Control Shampoo"	"good"
"the brushes weren't packed very nicely, and when i opened it the handle was already coming off. i had to crazy glue the handle. otherwise the hairs on the brush are really soft."	"not that great."	"neutral"
"Promising product, but my hair is just too thin to cover the holder. I'm going to give it to my sister who has super thick hair, and maybe it will get some use."	"Not for thin hair."	"bad"
"This is a great sunscreen.  It goes on smooth, and feels like satin on the skin.  It also feels weightless, and dissapears into your skin perfectly.  Does not leave any oil on the skin, or a shine whatsoever.Plus, the SPF factor is great -- 40! -- and it's got broad enough protection to cover both UVA and UVB rays, i.e., the ones that cause cancer, and the ones that cause premature aging.  It does have a pigment to it, but it disappeared rather quickly.It also doesn't have any annoyingly perfumey or chemically smells, which I love.  I will happily use this over any drugstore or over-the-counter brand anyday."	"This stuff is awesome"	"good"
"It does alright on bleaching the dark marks and is much cheaper than proactiv dark spot corrector but made me break out"	"Ambi"	"neutral"
"This came from Target, so it probably was not old. I do not have time to worry about returning it. Will not get again. Also will avoid buying from Target online after this as well. Unbelievably bad!. It is as if you are trying to put clumpy mascara on as eyeliner!!!"	"The worst eyeliner ever. Clumpy, not smooth"	"bad"
"It says 1 kit bottle, but actually it is a nice tray with 13 little tubes of lotion 1 for each of the first 13 days and then a wonderful mask for day 14.My face was noticeably softer after just the first night. The little tubes in the tray fit nicely on your counter and have a professional appreance.For the price this is an excellent system - well worth the cost."	"Skin is smoother, less red. Nice container"	"good"
"These exfoliating wipes have some good qualities, but they are a bit too rough for my skin.  The pads scratch my face instead of exfoliating and lifting the dead skin cells.  I wouldn't recommend them for people with sensitive skin.  Great idea, but I need something that is a bit more gentle."	"A Bit too Scratchy for my Skin"	"neutral"
"I like my regular conditioner better.  I didn't see anything special this conditioner did, no glowing or silkiness.  I guess it is just okay.  I wouldn't buy it.  Soybean product in conditioner?  I don't like the idea of soybeans in my conditioner.  Maybe that's why the hair didn't glow or was silky.  This conditioner might be good for some, but not for me.  Oh, it's usable if you don't have anything else, but I wouldn't buy it.  It could have gotten 3 stars, but the soybeans brought it down to one."	"Conditioner"	"bad"
"You get everything you would need to start doing makeup in this kit, also it comes in a neat shaped carrying case. I love this a lot, it makes a beginner take a sigh of relief so they don't have to worry about if they have all the basics or not."	"Great for starter"	"good"
"It came very fast. It came in like 3 days I think. I have dark skin so the color doesn't look that good on me but it looks cool. This really is a winter color. I don't know why I decided to buy it in the middle of summer lol. I may used it in the winter but not now. & the formula is amazing ! You really can get away with one coat !"	"It's ok."	"neutral"
"This &#34;3 in 1&#34; shampoo, conditioner and body wash has the consistency, feel and look of regular shampoo.  The scent is labeled as &#34;pineapple&#34;; it is a fruity scent, citrusy and sweet, and somewhat like pineapple.For use as shampoo, it worked well leaving squeaky clean hair.  It did not appear to condition, however, and left hair with tangles and not soft like most conditioner.For use as a body wash, it was most disappointing.  It did not make a thick lather like soap, but instead just a few suds in the hands.  When washed away, it left a a sticky residue that actually required soap and water to remove.For use only as shampoo, to be followed by conditioner, this product works fine.  However, it does not work as advertised.  I would advise to spend the extra money on three separate products instead of using this one."	"Shampoo Okay, Conditioner and Body Wash Not"	"bad"
"That's what the ladies will say. This is a cologne you need to wear. You won't regret it. Trust me. Just buy it. Actually don't buy it braise I don't want you to smell like me."	"\"Omg what are you wearing\""	"good"
"it didn't really help with lightening my knees, elbows or armpits. they didn't really help with scars, and didn't really help with a couple of pimplos here and there."	"eh"	"neutral"
"Dont bother. Barely fit even my cheap NYC bottles which are fairly small compared to OPI. Cheap plastic. I got two of the same styles, which would be the pink one in the picture. I did not receive the white one pictured. Ugh. Just putting polish on the table would be less of a headache."	"Lame"	"bad"
"I use this brush to apply my cream eyeshadows.  The bristles are the perfect length to provide control of the placement of the creamy shadows, and have just the right softness to the bristles as well.  I highly recommend this brush.  This brush would also make a great concealor brush; if I had another one I would definitely use it for that as well.  Looks like I'll have to buy another one!"	"Great Brush; Great Price"	"good"
"I was afraid when I opened the package at 1st as I saw 2 tiny & yet very expensive bottles inside. I was & still am somewhat skeptical but I am also optimistic & you never know if something is going to work for you or not if you don't suck it up & give a try. This is only the second day & I will add on to this review after this trial, but I can already say something positive about this stuff. It smells great & absorbs very quickly, my skin loves it & already shows improvement in firmness & smootheness. Hopefully the deep dimples & bulges will smooth away over time with continued use & massage, healthy diet & excercise. No cellulite lotion is to bear all the wieght of cellulite removal entirely, but I can already tell that this is a formidable aide in my cellulite prevention & treatment regime. I also bought the Delphin Anti-cellulite shorts too but haven't used them yet. I certainly will tommorow after applying the am lotion, before hopping on my elliptical! I must say, if I am to continue to use this product, (no matter how great it is) the price needs to come down a little bit at least (without compromising quantity or quality of the product). I am not rich by any means & today's middle class income standards (based on ridiculous & outlandish annual \"cost of living increases\") are still considered rich to me lol! All women deserve to look & feel their best regardless of status or income level!April 2013: Well I am back to say I did not experience as much a smoothing effect as i like. I still have the deep diples & minor \"orange peel\" look. If I am to continue to use a product it has to be more effective than this."	"I like it so far!"	"neutral"

"I have tried so many different brands of mascara. This is the best brand that I have found. Very little clumping and it separates the lashes nicely to give a fullness. Highly recommended!"	"Best mascara!!"	"good"
"I've used sweet almond oils before that smelled that had a distinct rich almond smell, but this product had no smell.  It moisturizes nicely, but I don't think all almond oils are equal because I tried some at Whole Foods (I WISH I could remember the brand) and it absorbed sooo nicely!  This product is ok, but I won't be repurchasing sadly because the price is nice."	"Ok Almond oil, but where's the \"sweet\" part?"	"neutral"
"I need to stop trying BB creams and stick with one I already know works well. Instead I was at Walgreens feeling spendy and saw this.It was from L'Oreal, a decent brand, which has other products I have used and been satisfied with. How could I not try a tube of the light/medium? I snuck a little onto the back of my hand and it looked good, plus it was marked way down.While it wasn't a huge loss, I wish I hadn't bothered. If you want to know about L'Oreal BB creams, I'm your girl and this is your review.A true BB cream will give you \"glow\", minimize skin imperfections, and if good, can even take the place of your foundation. I had found all these assets in a different L'Oreal' product, their Skin Beautifier BB Cream, and thought perhaps their Age Perfect BB Cream Instant Radiance version would be even better. Not even close.This stuff evolves on your skin. When I first put it on, it was alarming - very orangy and greasy-looking (though it was not greasy, just shiny). Maybe 15 minutes later it had settled down with less shine, but a few hours later (maybe 3) it was just gone. Zero tint, zero coverage. I know not to expect major coverage from a BB cream, but this was ridiculous. Nothing was left.As for the possibility of using it as a semi-foundation... nope. I tried applying a second coat in case more was required for results or staying power, but still nada. It is not buildable and a heavier coating doesn't last longer or look better.I have also tried the L'Oreal Paris Youth Code BB Cream Illuminator (Medium) and it was as useless as this Age Perfect one, except the Youth Code one did not disappear, it just never appeared, period. Nothing. A glorified colored sunscreen calling itself a BB cream because BB creams are hot right now.The other, superior Skin Beautifier BB Cream (now also being called \"Studio Secrets\") leaves my skin tone even with a subtle pearly finish, minimizes pores, and makes my face look flawless. This is the one that works for me and from which I should not stray. It's light, non-greasy, gives no greasy appearance, provides some light coverage and looks natural.If you are experimenting with BB Creams and not looking to fork out a wad of cash for a premium one, I'd suggest trying the L'Oreal Magic Skin Beautifier BB Cream. You might even try the Maybelline (which was ok but too shiny for my taste). But don't let this Age Perfect Instant Radiance product be your only try of BB creams because there's better stuff out there, honest."	"A bad try at getting on the BB cream bandwagon"	"bad"
"THIS CONDITIONER IS EXCELLENT FOR MY 3C HAIR. iT LEAVES MY HAIR VERY SOFT. IT IS GOOD FOR TRAVELING BECAUSE I CAN USE IT FOR MY CO-WASH, LEAVE IN, DEEP CONDITIONER."	"TRESEMME NATURALS CONDITIONER, VIBRANTLY SMOOTH, WITH COCONUT OIL AND JOJOBA"	"good"
"These wipes really DO get all of my makeup off.  They work great for eye makeup, which is the whole purpose of my purchasing these. I use one before I get in the shower for 2 reasons. 1.) They burn my eyes and irritate the skin around them.2.) I dislike the residue these wipes leave on my skin.They really do work well... I just feel the need to still shower and wash my face after I use these. I'm trying a different brand once these are gone"	"Efficient but..."	"neutral"
"I normally use Loreal Revitalift as my daily moisturizer. This product falls short in several areas.First it is greasy when it first goes on and feels tacky and heavy. That dissipates for the most part after it is absorbed but the Loreal is much lighter feeling. Second, perhaps because it is a heavier, greasier lotion but it does not sit as well under my foundation. (Covergirl Aquasmooth)It presents a less natural appearance and the makeup tends to cake on. Third, it only offers half the SPF, 15 compared to 30. I have very fair skin and am prone to freckling so the higher SPF is very important to me.  And finally, the smell is much too strong for a facial product.I personally did not see any benefit that it added over my current lotion and it had too many negative aspects for me to recommend it."	"Falls short"	"bad"
"This product was tested, directly after using 'CLEAR SCALP ANTI-DANDRUFF SHAMPOO.' The results were very pleasing. Many Conditioners on the market leave hair oily and greasy, this product doesn't. After a few days of using this product, hair is still clean and conditioned well, without that greasy wet look. Highly Recommended for all those with dry scalp problems, caused by skin conditions or extreme heat conditions. I would continue using this product."	"\"THE RIGHT CHOICE!\""	"good"
"Product has a dropper and is more white than the translucent drop they show on the picture.  Nice smell, although it absolutely does smell like the other argan oil products, only much lighter.  I have used the pure oil in the past and have been very pleased with the results, and the pure oil is very expensive.  The Nexxus product does not produce the same shine as the pure oil.  Nor does it have the overwhelming smell, just a light scent of argan.  I have only used a drop or two - I think I may use double that to see if I get the shine.  The treatment makes your hair virtually knot free, so it is much easier to brush.  I thought this product was really good, but if I have to buy again, I would probably go with a lesser expensive option, like the oil treatment made by Suave.  The Suave product has a slightly stonger smell, costs only a third of the Nexxus and produces pretty good shine.  All of these products will knock the frizz down, so if you are looking for a daily de-frizz - anything with argan oil is a good choice."	"Another argan oil derivitive"	"neutral"
"I was expecting these to be nail polish pens, similar to the nail art pens from Sally Hanson.First, the tip is a hard plastic tube, similar to a tube of nail glue. You need to cut the tip and use a pin to make a hole.Second, the tube is full of air so even if you try to squeeze the paint out to &#34;draw&#34; on your nail, it comes out in a big thick blob. Then more air, then more blob. So I thought I would try to squeeze the paint out and use a nail brush to draw my image but the paint is to thick and not at all like nail polish. The paint is more like washable paint for kids. I don't think these should be advertised as nail polish pens. It would cost more to send them back so I will use the paint for art projects."	"NOT nail polish, just paint..NOT good."	"bad"
"I am a big fan of microdermabrasion. Some time ago I had a series of salon treatments and my skin felt baby soft and I received a number of compliments. However, salon treatments are pricey so I looked into buying an at home microdermabrasion machine. I purchased one that used crystals and initially I really liked it. But recently I became concerned about the safety of the crystals. In addition, though the machine was cheaper than a trip to the salon the cost of replacement crystals added up to quite a bit. And disposing of the plastic crystal containers is not very eco-friendly (plus it is messy) so I decided to look for another machine.I did a lot of research. I wanted a machine that was user friendly, gentle to the skin and very effective. When I did my research I was surprised to find such huge differences in the machines. One machine seemed to work at first but died out fast. Another small handheld machine seemed very convenient but I read numerous complaints from users where they actually scratched their skin with it. My goal was to look better -not like I had been in a cat fight. So that made me stay away from that one.I decided to try the MicrodermMD. Happily I found I really love the machine and so does my skin! The machine is in a compact white unit with a mirror. It has attached tubing with a diamond tip that you run over your face to exfoliate. There is also an attachment you can use without the diamond tip. This attachment may be used for blackheads but you can also run it over the skin and stimulate circulation. One of the beauties of a microdermabrasion machine is not only getting rid of dead skin cells revealing the fresh skin beneath, but also to stimulate circulation and this tip does that perfectly! So you can use the product in between exfoliations if desired.A tiny felt pad collects the dead skin as you run the unit over your face. And it is easily removed and disposed of. This keeps the unit hygenic.One of the coolest things about the machine is the LCD display. This feature actually flashes a demonstration on how to use the unit correctly so you will get the best results. You can watch it as you exfoliate. The demonstration has a face on it so you will know where to move the crystal tip - very simple. Everything, the tips, pads, tube etc. fit into the compact cast for easy storage. I also really like that the unit is easy to use, no messy scrubs or crystals.I think you have to be reasonable about expectations with microdermabrasion. It is not going to eliminate deep scarring. It will however, get rid of that top layer of skin, help minimize pores and fine lines and give the skin a fresher look. After my first treatment my skin had a lovely, pinkish glow.Price wise the machine is not inexpensive but it is comparable to other at home microdermabrasion machines and when you consider the price for salon visits it is a true value. The unit comes with 100 replacement filters. I did check on the price of replacement filters and they currently run $25 for 100 (use one new filter per treatment) with free shipping. I think they could be less expensive, but when you think of all the lotions and potions you buy that don't work, paying $25 for 100 skin treatments is a bargain.After just a few treatments, my skin feels softer, smoother and fresher. It is a subtle thing but really makes a big difference in how my overall facial appearance. I love it!Really nice product. Highly recommend!"	"Smooth, glowing skin!"	"good"
"This mascara was very black and not too expensive. But it clumped too easily and I threw it away after a few uses. Now using CK mascara from Ulta which is pricey but never clumps."	"Black but..."	"neutral"
"Picked up this product for my daughter. She has tried it out, but says it doesn't have any benefit. She stopped using it after several uses and then gave it to a friend to try. She told me not to get it again. Oh well. At least it is a cheap product, so it may still be worth a try for you or someone in your family..."	"For the price, it may be worth a try, but I can't recommend it..."	"bad"

"The main thing with these creams is you have to be diligent and consistent, which I wasn't. It is a PAIN in the butt to do it every night and every morning, scrubbing with the somewhat painful glove I bought with it. It did make my skin super smooth, but cellulite is a bitch to get rid of even with exercise (lots of thin people I know have cellulite, so it's definitely not a fat people thing). Long story short, I got tired of the routine and gave up."	"I guess it's my fault."	"neutral"
"I initially tried this because I had given up on clearing my adult acne. I had seen a doctor who said they would give me an RX for it - which I'm not comfortable with (for reoccurring acne). I decided to try the Proactiv starter kit - sounds simple and easy.I found these products to be very small for such a big cost. And yes, they automatically billed my card for a second order *automatically* in 2 months. So I found myself with very small products, overly priced and figured I might as well try them - or just return them. I tried them, the combo of the acne fighting ingredients proved too strong for my skin. I went from bad adult acne (zits, pimples, redness) to cystic acne (large, deep painful zits). I returned the entire product, stopped membership and was returned all costs. But this took three tries over the phone to complete, it took over one billing cycle to see the full amount returned."	"Very strong formula, high price"	"bad"
"I have tried a bunch of masks over the years but this one is really good. I have mixed skin but sometimes still get little breakouts. This is gentle and really gets the pores clean. My skin looks great everytime I use it!"	"Really cleans your skin and I feel like my pores are clear"	"good"

If you do use in the am, I would suggest using a small amount and waiting for a few minutes before applying concealer etc.  I will give the product a chance to sink in.  A little goes a long way.  I think the jar will last a long time.  I also use on my cuticles.  I would definitely buy again."	"Eye Cream"	"good"
"I went the mall and was amazed at how great my hair looked when someone used this on me.  However, the mall price was close to 200 dollars, knew I could find it on here for much cheaper.  Great price, but I can't seem to figure out how to use it correctly without burning myself or it taking hours.  I have very thick hair and you have to section your hair in really small pieces in order to see results.  Not too thrilled about spending hours on my hair so I bought hot rollers instead.  I would probably return this if I could."	"Not worth the time if you have thick hair"	"neutral"
"These lashes are seriously natural. Why would you want something that looks just as short (if not shorter) than your lashes? If you are thinking of doubling them up with another type of longer lash to give it depth- then you would still be let down. save your pennies"	"crapola"	"bad"

"I have thin and fine hair.  This particular shampoo is just not a good match for my hair type.  Even after thoroughly rinsing, I could feel a greasy residue in my hair and on my scalp.  I only used this shampoo for 2 days, and my hair looked limp and greasy both days.  On the 3rd day, I used a clarifying shampoo to finally rid myself of the residue.  This shampoo would probably be better suited to a person with thicker, coarser hair than my own."	"Not good for my thin and fine hair..."	"neutral"
"I should have paid more attention to the description.  These are very small sizes, probably worth thre money, but they weren't very moisturizing.  (I have dry, mature skin). If you're already using thre brand, thren it's probably okay for a few trips."	"Not what I expected"	"bad"

"I have been using this Twice and sometimes even three times daily for the past two months and I have seen very little improvement. I wasn't expecting my freckles to be gone completely, but from all the reviews I had read, I did expect it to lighten them.  Unfortunately they don't seem to be any lighter. I do also use an SPF.  Although it did not work for me it's a pretty decent moisturizer. I will continue to use this and hope to see some kind of improvement. Either way it's still good for a moisturizer wether it works or not."	"I wish it had worked for me"	"neutral"

"I am in love with this eye cream.  First, I love that it comes in a larger size than most eye creams out there.  The scent is faint but lovely, and the eye cream itself is so soft and creamy and feels soothing when you put it on.  It blends well and works great.  I was just putting this in my eye area at first, and loved the results so started also using it on my forehead and face where I am starting to get wrinkles.  I should probably just see if they also offer a full face cream.  This is the first product by Yalmeh that I have tried and I am hooked, I am looking forward to trying their other creams and hope they are as nice as this one.  I have dry/combo skin and am 47, I live in a very dry climate and this cream lasts all day.  I also use it at night for an overnight treatment and wake up looking refreshed, un-puffy and smooth around my eyes."	"Soft, delicate, effective cream"	"good"

"This is a nice eyeshadow, goes on smooth, doesn't crease and is long lasting.  That being said, to get a deeper depth of color it has to be applied a bit on the thick side.

"~These eye make-up remover pads worked well; they removed my eye make-up and did not dry out my skin.  I wish they were a little bigger and a little thicker.

"I do not have a reference point, as I never used unrefined shea butter before.  This product has rather faint tobacco smell and it is bright yellow, which, as I understand, suggests that something was added to it. Also, it is not certified by ASBI or any other organization, which leaves some doubts regarding authenticity.  It does not absorb into skin quickly, but seems to be a good emollient.  I use it on my feet and put on socks overnight - they are stained with dark spots in the morning.  Is it the way it's supposed to be?UPDATE.  I purchased shea butter from an ASBI-certified supplier.  Upon comparing the two products, it seems that there is definitely shea butter in the product that is being reviewed. The smell is the same as the ASBI-certified product. However, it is either not Grade A butter, or it is past the expiration date, or maybe it was reheated many times.  It is very grainy [which may be due to reheatings], takes much longer to melt when rubbed between the palms, and longer to absorb into skin than the ASBI-certified product.  It may also be mixed with some oil, because it is oilier than the ASBI-certified product, and its color is bright yellow, not ivory."	"Uncertain quality"	"neutral"

"The purpose I wanted to use this was for reducing age spots, as my doc recommended I use salycylic acid for them, as well as an actinic keratosis (I had asked him to burn or peel off the spots but he wouldn't and referred me to the S.A.).For me it was very gentle, and I felt no burning whatsoever. It's weird because others here are reporting burning sensation, frosting, etc. I didn't. Not sure if it's because I already regularly use prescription retin-a, so my skin is 'tougher'? or if it was an irregular batch? (a few other reviewers mentioned the same thing too.)So I would say it would be excellent as a cleanser or to unclog pores, since the salycylic acid is one of the most effective for that, and this product supposedly has a decent percentage.I ended up usingCompound W Wart Remover Fast-Acting Gel: .25 OZ!I know, good old Compound W! It has 17% S.A., the mfr does not recommend use on the face though, which is odd since all the other S.A. products here are for the face -- my guess is because of the strength. I would never put it all over, just on individual sunspots on keratosis. For me it's working and definitely frosts! Again it takes time, just like anything, not an instant fix.But this Perfect Image product is a good one for declogging pores and acne, and it seems quite gentle."

"This is a blue colored shampoo with little or no significant smell. It is somewhat more viscous than other shampoos but did not make my hair smell good or add new depth to it.

It doesn't stick to my face.  The directions say something about using it over and over again 2-3 nights which is crazy because I barely can make it through night 1 and thats it.

I use it in the morning and I am still free from any wrinkles , it give me 10 years back for real, it is not wonder cream but it is just so good for preventing wrinkle formation , young people don;t care about wrinkles but when they get it they look for miracle , the answer is to not allow them forming and prevent it for ever using good cream like this one , nothing else works for me ...and I hope they will never stop producing it , this cream was number 1 last year for the most effective in preventing of wrinkle formations on dry and mixed skin type"	"My Favorite"	"good"

I smelled it in the store and it didn't have any smell then. I guess since there's so many smells, I didn't pick it up but when I got home and put it all over my face I noticed it smells really weird. Not like perfume like a lot of liquid foundations do... maybe a chemical smell. I tried washing it off with hot water and soap and it took foreverrrrrrr! This stuff STAYS! I finally got it off and could still smell it on my skin FIVE HOURS later!

I felt like it did make it glossy but it verged on the edge of looking oily from being dirty. This was using it as a finishing spray. I have also used it before blow drying and that is a better experience as it seems to have more time to absorb into the hair. It has a nice light scent.

"I was recommended this product by a hair stylist.  And at $50 a bottle and with thinning hair in my 20s I went for it .  It didn't work.  It cleared the sebum problem up with my hair, but because the detergents were so harsh, it gave my scalp dermatitis.  It did nothing to make my hair look nicer, but certainly stripped all the color out of that I got at the salon.  I also had no visible growth from using this product and did WAY better just using hair vitamins and rogaine together.For the price, there's more NATURAL products that'll deliver at least healthy results for your hair."

"I sent this to my mom because she loves to try out new facial products.  She used it for the first time yesterday and she says she has no intention of using another one until summer.  She's in Phoenix so it's not exactly cold, but she said the first 8 minutes were uncomfortably cold that she thought she wasn't going to make it the full 10 minutes.  She said the last two minutes were actually refreshing, but not worth the first 8 minutes of painful cold.Initially she liked how you just unfold and place the mask on, but that was the only thing she liked about it.  After ten minutes you remove the mask and rub in the moisturizer.  Mom mom said he face felt slimy for the next hour.  She of course was outside during that hour and kept wondering how much dirt was collecting on her face.She's sending me a couple to try for myself because she's not a fan.  But she is holding onto some to try during the oppressive Phoenix summer.  She figures that it may be completely refreshing then.  And, she plans on staying indoors during the time the moisturizer is being absorbed into her skin."	"Not for winter use"	"bad"

"Like ourprevious attempts at Suave's 3-in-1 line, our experience with the Pineapple was just okay.  I think it comes of a product trying to do too much, and not doing any of it particularly well.As shampoo it doesn't really lather and wash, nor does it completely rinse out easily, and it leaves a little residue that makes hair less squeeky-clean than L'oreal or J&J.;  Conversely the conditioner is not very strong, so on my 3yo and 7yo girls' long hair they had to supplement with a second rinse with proper conditioner or use a spray-in detangler.  It's fine for body wash, but then that was always the easy part.More importantly, my 3yo managed to splash some in her eye on two separate occasions this month (as 3yo's do) and both times she screamed and cried that it was \"burning\" her.  Both times her eye was bloodshot and clearly irritated for a LONG time after her bath.  While I've yet to find a truly tears-free shampoo, this seems like excessive irritation for a product passing itself off as one.The Suave 3-in-1 is a decent choice for a quick bath where you're already fighting to get the kiddos to bed, or for travel where easier is better, I wouldn't recommend it for a regular purchase.  Instead we've had much better experiences withAvalon OrganicsandSweet Baby(not tear-free, but actually 100% natural and free from all the other chemicals usually found in shampoo), and even withL'Oreal Kids 2-in-1."

"I expected much more out of these makeup brushes given the great overall reviews they got.My issue with this package of brushes is that it comes with about 5-6 brushes that are used for the exact same technique for eye makeup! Excuse me but I don't need 5 of the same brush style. I need 5 different brushes so I can create different shading and looks with my eye makeup.I think the biggest shadow brush is too small and tight. To put on the different shades on your eye, it takes so long because the brush size is small.Anyway, you would think that with 12 brushes you would get variety. Instead I have an entire brush set that does the same thing with my eye shadow. I'm thinking of purchasing another set of brushes that will actually help me put on eye shadow differently."	"5 different sizes of the exact same brush"	"bad"
"This is a very interesting cream.  It is not greasy and is thicker than I expected.  The scent is a little strange somewhat medicinal with a hint of coffee.  When I apply it there is a slight tightening effect which doesn't last long, and my skin is soft and feels moisturized.  I did notice that it stated to reduce water retention, and in my case it does work for that.  Not much difference with the cellulite yet but it hasn't been that long."	"Good Cream!"	"good"

"The first time I used this, I noticed there is no lather. Not too big of a deal because I've used natural products and was expecting little to no lather. Second thing I noticed was when I rinsed my hair it was grippy like if you've ever washed with a bar of soap when you forgot to bring shampoo on a trip. Third, I noticed the water just dripped off of my hair and drying time was significantly reduced. I was very happy,Until I used it a second time and then a third time. The third time was the worst. My hair had an oily buildup and I rinsed it a long time under warm water. My hair looked and felt much greasier than before I washed to a disgusting level. In fact, my hair has NEVER been that greasy in my entire life. It looked like I hadn't washed in two months. I have come to realize the more I used this shampoo bar, the more buildup I had. Because I had no clarifying shampoo, I created my own with vinegar and boiled water. That worked to remove the oily buildup and my hair looked clean and fresh with no tangles.Sadly, I won't be able to use this shampoo bar except for every once in a while and never twice in a row."

AND, when i tried to take it off, it wouldn't come off. it stained my eyelid for a couple days.I am using this as a crazy expensive regular marker... and it's not even good at that. Save your money and get something else (i personally liked revlon colorstay and loreal felt tip liners). if you really would like to try this, buy a nontoxic marker from a dollar store and try it on your eyes. i guarantee you it would work better than this marker."

HYDROXATONE 90 SECOND WRINKLE REDUCER will not erase deeply etched lines in your face or dark, droopy bags from under your eyes.  It will however, for a while, reduce under eye puffiness and firm up those fine little laugh lines.  HYDROXATONE 90 SECOND WRINKLE REDUCER works by tightening up puffy skin and fine wrinkles.  It also contains \"optically advanced light-diffusing ingredients\" (whatever those are) which reflect and diffuse the light around your eyes, giving you (temporarily) a brighter, more youthful glow (something that Hollywood has been doing with movie makeup for years).Does HYDROXATONE 90 SECOND WRINKLE REDUCE last for 8 hours?  Honestly, I am not sure. After tapping in a small amount and then waiting for about 90 seconds, my morning puffiness is definitely reduced.  I can see a distinct difference.  I also feel more awake, because of the skin tightening around my eyes.  Psychologically, do I feel better because I look better, or do I look better because I feel better?  Who knows?  However, the puffiness is reduced and I feel more awake.  Which is a definite plus.  But I can't tell you if it lasts 8 hours, because after two hours or so of being awake, my normal morning puffies are gone anyway.  So maybe it just gives me an early morning advantage.  I'll take it!I have had none of the issues with the pump that others have experienced. Works just fine for me each time.  You only need a very small amount, so the small bottle lasts a long time, which is important considering the price.  It has not irritated my skin and seems fairly gentle.Overall, if you need an extra early morning pick-me-up in your beauty routine, then HYDROXATONE 90 SECOND WRINKLE REDUCE is worth a try."

"I hate the Banana Boat Sport Coolzone Sunscreen Lotion spf 30 and simply can't stomach the scent. I like the smell of menthol but couldn't exactly describe what fragrance might have been added to this absorbant lotion.  Because I experienced a skin reaction too, I had to wash it off shortly after the initial application, I can't say whether or not it performs well as a water resistant sunscreen on my own body. A friend used it when we were out and he also commented about the unpleasant fragrance.  He didn't get sunburned in the hours we were in the sun and he reapplied after swimming at my request.  For that reason, I can award this 2 stars instead of one. We didn't use this on the face because we didn't trust the ingredients to be non-reactive. The fragrance is strong enough to emanate from another body and remains even after being washed with soap and water."	"Hope you like it better than I"	"bad"
"Ok, first off, I have sensitive skin and it is really hard for me to find anything that doesn't turn me beet red or give me lovely little pimples all over my cheeks and chin. L'Oreal's Triple Power Lotion didn't give me high hopes. And when I pumped it out and applied it I wasn't happy with how greasy it went on. It was like an oil slick on my face. But happily that didn't last long. What it left behind, after sinking in, was velvety smooth skin! I haven't seen a reduction in wrinkles but I take great care of my skin and truly don't have any deep lines. Now for the downside ... the smell. It is way to perfume-like and is very overpowering. After I put it on, bummed around the house a bit, then climbed into bed my husband thought I had just sprayed on perfume."	"Greasy, but ..."	"good"
"This moisturizer smells wonderful, and rose fragrance is nice and light. I received a sample (1/2 oz?) as part of a set. After 2-3 uses, I got a few pimples. Can't say for sure if this moisturizer was the cause, but that would be my guess (I did try the products of the set one at a time). Am using what's left as a hand cream.About my breakout, I will say that I am prone to that, so even if this moisturizer did cause a zit or two on my face, that doesn't mean it would on someone else's skin.About jar formulation: for the sample size, I thought the little jar was fine. But a 2-oz jar? I would rather this product be packaged in a tube, not only for sanitary reasons but for helping to keep air out. With so many ingredients, in addition to moisture, I would think this product would lose its potency after so many uses. The spatula might help keep bacteria out, but then you have to keep up with the spatula and keep it clean.Certainly a 4-oz jar is way too big for a facial moisturizer with all of these rejuvenating ingredients."	"Great rose fragrance, but may not be good for break-out prone skin"	"neutral"
"The first razor out of the package felt as though it was dull from the very first swipe. These are intended to trim the lady bits -- the package comes with three razors and a separate trimmer attachment -- but I used it on my legs first, because nothing goes near the bits until I test it out first. I'm glad I did, because the conditioning strip did nothing, just felt like a piece of dry cardboard, and the razors were dull. It was irritating and uncomfortable right out of the package.That said, the second and third razors were better, so I'm thinking there's a quality control issue here. It only lasted one shave on the legs, though, when most razors last two, sometimes three on the higher-quality disposables.Then came time to try the trimmer attachment. It's a kind of comb with a razor underneath meant to trim (let's be honest) the bush. It looks very similar in shape to the attachment on the electric razor I usually use. One swipe of this Bic attachment and it was clogged. Cleaned it off, did a second swipe, and it was dull enough I didn't want to use it anymore, so I used a third swipe to &#34;even things out&#34; and moved on with my life. I'd say that this said more about the hair on my bod than the razors, but other brands have worked just fine, and I see other reviewers had similar issues, so I'm thinking the razor is the issue in this particular situation. I really cannot recommend these razors at all."	"the dullest, saddest razor I've ever used"	"bad"

"I have average eye lashes, as far as length is concerned and dark brown eyes with dark brown eyelashes/eyebrows. This mascara is pretty much the same as any other middle of the line mascara on the market.  It goes on smooth and has a good color (jet black). It does work well at lengthening the lashes, however, it does leave clumps that have to be pulled out by using an eyelash brush.  It doesn't do too well with the lower lashes-the brush isn't quite thin enough to get a completely clean application.  Overall, it's pretty average, so don't expect too much."	"Nothing new"	"neutral"
"Just as the title states it made my eyes flaky/crusty, and people were commenting on how tired I looked. I used this for 2 weeks religiously and saw no improvement at all.

"This mascara is surprisingly lightweight -- it went on smoothly, with no flakes, and it didn't feel gloppy, glommy, or heavy at all.  It did seem to take a long time to dry.  It was fairly effective at lengthening my lashes, and it gave a very natural, clean look.  I'm not sure that it increased the volume, though.  It was also prone o smudging.I have super sensitive eyes and although I love my makeup, I typically avoid mascara because it often flakes and smears.  When I do wear mascara, I use waterproof because it doesn't smudge and smear as easily.  I'm not sure that I would use this again because it is not waterproof and is susceptible to smears and smudges.  I think this would work well if you are going for a natural look, but if you're looking for super-glam or if you're prone to streaks and smudges, perhaps you should pass on this mascara.  ."

"August 28, 2012I just threw away my second brush.  The replacement brush lasted only four months.  I love this brush, but it should last longer than eight or four months.  I am looking for another brand, but it makes me sad.  This is the best brush I have ever used, but two brushes in one year worn to uselessness is just too much.  I cannot understand the problem, but it seems to me it is how the bristles are attached to the padding.  The balls break off and then the whole bristle pushes into the padding.May 17, 2012  Updated Review:Half the end balls were gone and the entire center of the brush have broken off.  It lasted eight months.  I have just retired it and started the replacement they sent me when I emailed them that the balls were disappearing at a fast rate.  Good brush, good company, very short lifetime of use.January 31, 2012, Updated Review:I took the suggestion of a person who commented on my review and emailed the company.  Within five days I had a new brush in the mail.  Wow!  I am so impressed with the Phillips company.  Few companies just make it right anymore.  I would suggest buying Phillips company products because not only do they make great products, they stand behind and make any problems right.  I wish more companies had this old fashioned ethic.December 31, 2011 Original Review:I adored this brush and still like it very much.  I have never had a brush I liked so very much.  Unfortunately, I am already losing the balls on the ends of the brush that keep the bristles from scratching.  I have had it four months and have lost three end balls.  I think that by the time I have had it a year I will have lost at least 12 end balls.  I am severely disappointed and surprised about this.  So maybe another brush would be a better choice."

I've been using it for years, but it's rather expensive when I buy it from my stylist ($18 bottle, but just found on Amazon in a double-set for same priceTIGI Bed Head After the Party Smoothing Cream, 3.4 Ounce (Pack of 2)). Thought I would try this as a Amazon Vine reviewer, but was slightly disappointed.It left my hair feeling dry and although it did flatten out the thickness a bit, it still felt frizzy. If I used a handful of it, the results were better, but still not a viable replacement to After Party.The best thing is the scent. I love the coconutty scent...very nice!For the price, this isn't a bad product."	"After-Party still my fav!"	"neutral"

So basically, if you want to smell like an old lady and still have cellulite, use this product.  NO topical cream can reduce cellulite.

"Had to try this after reading about how great Argan Oil is for the skin and hair.  It does live up to the hype and is WONDERFUL!  Worked great for me for my skin.  I use it for under the eye area to give it extra TLC and I have to say that works great!  I am oily so I am not prone to wrinkles, but I do make sure that I do everything in my power to NOT get wrinkles and this Argan Oil is part of my regiment to battle unwanted wrinkles!  :)  I also mix this in with my hair conditioner to keep my hair soft which is a challenge if you color your hair!  Shhhh.  Don't tell anyone!  :)  Seriously, it works great for my hair as well and I use it after my bath every day and have been loving how my hair feels.Skin looks good.  Hair looks good!

"Bought this because my dermatologist recommended the brand because it has Zinc or &#34;physical blockers&#34; which is desirable for sun protection. She said that although it has zinc which in the past ha been notoriously difficult to spread in and usually leaves white marks, this product did not do so. She was right it blends in smooth.I really haven't noticed a difference in terms of how well it protect some from the sun but it has been wonder since I purchased it so I haven't tested it out  in harsh conditions much.I didn't realize it was tinted when I initially purchased it and was disappointed when it arrived when I noticed it was tinted. I decided this was my error so I kept it. The tint doesn't really match my skin tone and it looks weird when it comes out of the tube; kind of like the tint is separating from the sunscreen portion. I'm not sure exactly how to explain it but it comes out appearing like the bottle needs to be shaken well before use. I don't know if this is because I got an old batch or something. I wont be buying this exact product again but I am not turned off by the brand in general since they are one of the few brands that uses blendable zinc and is reasonably priced. I think once this bottle is through I will break for Invisible Zinc."	"No noticable change since use"	"neutral"
"Despite the vegetable-based marketing, this product is not as natural as it seems. It contains a host of chemicals, including retinyl palimate, which may cause or accelerate the growth of skin cancers. Chemical complaints aside, it never seems to absorb in to my skin, and stays a little sticky all day. Worst of all, it does absolutely nothing to moisturize. My cheeks are so dry after just a few weeks that they actually burn, and my T-zone is producing oil on overtime to compensate. Yes To produces generally good products; this moisturizer is a BIG exception. Try Yes To Blueberries instead."	"This is NOT a natural product"	"bad"

Unfortunately, the shampoo and conditioner combo left my hair feeling weighed down and almost greasy. I think that if I had very thick, dry hair, that the effect of this shampoo would be welcome. However, it has the opposite effect on my fine hair. I also noticed that the claim of 70% split end reduction with the shampoo and conditioner was in comparison with a plain shampoo and no conditioner. So it's almost saying it's better than nothing. The results require 3 uses to reduce the split ends. After 3 uses, I had a buildup that was not desirable. I really wanted to love this product, but I didn't have that experience."

"I normally use Philosophy's Purity Made Simple to cleanse and remove makeup, but I wanted to give this a try since it's less expensive.  It does remove makeup completely and there was no irritation even when rubbing around my eyes to get off mascara.  The scent is pretty strong, heavy citrus/rose more like in cleaning products than skin care.  Also, it completely strips the oils from the skin, so my face felt overly tight after using.  I prefer the soft, moisturized fee my skin has after using Purity, so I will be going back to Philosophy."	"Removes makeup, but leaves skin tight and the scent is too strong"	"neutral"

I am glad it was cheap, which proves, you get what you pay for.I would rather spend $20.00 on liner that actually stays on for an entire day, even on very humid days, swimming or traveling.Who wants to arrive on their vacation with raccoon eyes?

The fragrance is pleasant but unassuming.  I feel like it cleans my hair well, and I can go for a day without using conditioner and don't feel like my hair is straw.Also - this may seem like a small thing, but the shape of the bottle is very easy to handle.

"I've only been taking these Biotin supplements for 2 1/2 weeks, but I can already tell a difference.  The last year or so, I've noticed that my hair is thinning in the front, and it's gotten worse the last few months as I've started perimenopause.  I've also had two nails that are splitting/peeling, and I haven't been able to grow them out or do anything to stop the splitting.  I bought the Biotin to help with these two problems, and so far it's already making a difference.While it's still too soon to notice any difference in the thickness of my hair, my splitting/peeling nails have already grown out to the point where they are no longer splitting.  In fact, the top layer of the nail that was separating from the rest of the nail seems to be more \"fused\" in place.  My nails also feel harder and stronger, and almost brighter.Additionally, I've also noticed that both my eyelashes and my eyebrows have gotten longer.  When I was curling my eyelashes the other day, they came past the place on the eyelash curler where they usually end; I've also had to tweeze my brows a bit more.At this rate, I'm very happy with this product since it has had noticeable results.  Like I said, I haven't noticed too much difference in the front of my hair, but I know that that is because it is still early in the process and it can take several months to have noticeable hair growth.It sort of snuck up on me, too, how quickly this was working.  The other day, I glanced down and was surprised to see that my nail was no longer splitting.  I wasn't expecting such quick results, and was pleasantly surprised.  Since I have seen results with my nails, eyelashes, and eyebrows, however, I know that this is working already, and I can't wait to see continued results with my hair.UPDATE ON 3/2/10:  I've been taking these Biotin tablets now for about two months, and notice a definite difference in my hair and nails.  The front of my hair has started filling in, and my hair is much thicker in those places where I had noticed some hair loss.  My nails are also growing really quickly, and they are strong, with no more cracking or peeling."	"Working well after just 2 1/2 weeks"	"good"
"Even when I was a skinny teenager and young adult, I had cellulite on my thighs and buttocks, and it's only gotten more unsightly as I've aged. This cream promises to \"get rid of cellulite\" in the title of this product page, but does not promise anything more than firming and reducing the appearance of cellulite on the jar itself. This is because only plastic surgery can accomplish that. I knew this going in, so my expectations were lower than perhaps others landing on this page.I tested this product by applying it to my left thigh and left buttocks twice a day for a few weeks. I intentionally did not touch my right side with the cream (or any creams or lotions, for that matter) so that I could judge the effectiveness of the product. Since diet, water intake, activity, caffeine consumption, and fat percentage can also affect the appearance of cellulite, I wanted a control side for comparison.First, my profile: I have a normal BMI, right in the middle of the range for my height. I am active, exercising most days by either walking, doing a treadmill workout, or playing tennis. I also consume caffeine in the first half of the day and drink plenty of water during the day. My diet is high in lean protein and vegetables. All of these things should result in cellulite reduction, yet I have it, as do all the women in my family.Next, the product and its application: The white cream has a consistency somewhere between a lotion and a thick cold cream. I used it generously, and it left a white layer that I had to massage into the skin for several minutes before it was absorbed enough for me to get dressed. Even though I have skin sensitivities to certain beauty products, I had no adverse reactions. I also didn't feel any tingling or tightening.Last, the results: My left side doesn't look any better than my right side, although the skin on the left is decidedly softer and more supple. I can imagine that the cream might work as a temporary aid for someone younger or with darker/tanned skin -- someone, that is, who has a minimal problem with visible cellulite.I give this product three stars instead of one because it is a good moisturizer and general skin conditioner. As with many cellulite reduction creams, this one contains caffeine, but also vitamin A, vitamin E, and a bunch of other ingredients, many from plants. (I love that the first ingredient is \"aqua (deionized water).\" It has a light, barely detectable scent. The company does offer a 100% money back guarantee which suggests to me that it must work for some people, just not me.

"I purchased this product more than a year ago at target during a sale.  In the past, I had used this product only three times because I knew from the first time that I didn't like the way it felt on my hair while wet but with all the other great reviews, I gave it two more fair chances.  There was absolutely no slip,my hair did not feel soft, or anything.  I even added extra virgin olive oil too it and it didn't change anything.  Usually I would have thrown away a useless product but I love the creamy consistency of this product so a few weeks ago I decided to see if I could use it as a moisturizer on my dry hair.  Before I apply this, I apply a dime-size amount of coconut oil(not virgin).  Maybe that's why it's starting to feel some kind of wonderful on my hair.  My hair feels hydrated and I only have to moisturize my hair every so often.  Just last night I applied it(last time was Tuesday), ran it through my strands from root to tip and now I wish to use it as a curl definer and moisturizer.  2 in 1.  I gave it three stars because I didn't feel like it lived up to it's title but I did have other uses for it."	"Hate as Masque.  Love as moisturizer!"	"neutral"
"I started using Nexxus Humectress in the early 1980s, when I had to buy it from a salon.  I loved how it deeply moisturized my hair (after shampooing) without weighing it down.  I sometimes used a tiny bit on my hair when it was dry to smooth down frizzies.  It was worth the salon price, and even when I lived overseas in the 90s I made sure to stock up on it when I was in the States.Unfortunately, the formula has changed and it's no longer the wonderful conditioner it used to be.  I bought a bottle a few months ago at Walmart, and I'm very disappointed.  It comes out of the bottle thinner and more watery, and leaves my hair limp and dull.  It doesn't rinse out cleanly the way it used to, and even the fragrance isn't as nice as it used to be.  The price has come down since they started selling it at retail stores, and now I know why.  I tried the new bottle several times before I realized what was causing me to have constant bad hair days, then I threw it in the trash.I get much better conditioning at a great price from Suave Professionals Humectant conditioner.  I won't be buying this new Nexxus Humectress again.  What a pity!"	"After 30 years, won't buy it again"	"bad"

"Revlon's Lip Butters are all about texture, but this one's the oddball. It's got a bit of frost to it (not sure, but I haven't seen any others in the series frosted), and I'm wondering whether that frost/shimmer is responsible for the slightly gritty texture that's even visible in the tube after it's used the first time. The color is pretty, though it shows up a bit deeper on me than the pictures here would lead me to expect. The texture doesn't feel bad on my lips--there's still plenty of slip--but it doesn't have the yummy feel of the others."	"Odd texture"	"neutral"

"The lotion?  4 stars.  The bottle?  2 stars.The lotion is very nice, with a high SPF.  I am very happy that L'Oreal came out with an SPF higher than the 18 of its original day lotion.  It goes on smoothly, and doesn't feel thick and gunky like some higher-SPF lotions.As for the bottle, I am at a loss.  The traditional wide pots that L'Oreal has always used are wonderful.  The lotion is easily accessible.  You can obtain the exact quantity you want.  And, very importantly, you can get every last little bit of the lotion.  Nothing is wasted.  But this pump bottle?  It is more difficult to obtain a precise quantity.  And it is impossible, unless you rip the top off, to get every last bit out before chucking the &#34;empty&#34; bottle.  After the bottle stopped dispensing (as if empty), I did indeed rip the top off, and discovered about 1/2&#34; of lotion left at the bottom.  That is a significant percentage of the total quantity.  Please, L'Oreal, put this lotion in one of the little pots!!!"	"Terrible Bottle!"	"neutral"
"I cowash my relaxed hair everyday.  I added this to my cowashes as a last rinse because it has amazing slip.  I had started leaving conditioner in my hair, usually my Aussie Moist, but this time I decided to use HH.  Later that day, I decided to rinse my hair so I could set it in a high bun.  I'm leaning over the tub with my hair in the shower and I'm combing my hair and just seeing strands and strands and then friggin CLUMPS of hair hit the bottom of tub!  The ONLY thing new was the HH!  I'd seen other posts where people said it made their hair come out but compared to the great reviews, it just didn't seem likely that it'd make my hair come out.  Boy was I wrong.

"I am 44 and, like my mother, I have always had sensitive skin. When I was a child, my mom always warned me about Olay products because she would have strong reactions to them. It may have been their scent, their chemical composition, or a combination, but it would burn her skin and make it red and painfully sore.It was with hesitation that I tried this, and I was pleasantly surprised.  It had a very light and pleasant scent, and was thicker in consistency than I expected or remembered from the past.I used the product for several weeks, and found that its SPF did protect my skin well. Several days, I spent a couple of hours out in the sun shortly after applying the product and I didn't burn.  After several straight weeks of usage, my skin looks brighter and fresher, perhaps it is actually a bit \"tighter.\" I know that's not really quantifiable but it does appear different. I have not changed anything else that I do, have not been relaxing on vacation, and have not gotten a tan, and I'm not pregnant, so this is the only thing I attribute the \"glow\" to.So, why did I give it only three stars? It's because of the ingredient list - parabens and too many ingredients that are not natural. I am guessing this is why people are saying my review isn't helpful, but the reality is that these and other dangerous ingredients are showing up in our blood, our breastmilk, and our babies. They are just dangerous.Update- I hate to admit it, but I've been using this product and the results are amazing. The product is rich and makes my skin immediately feel alive. I had run out of my all natural, paraben free moisturizer, and went to this....and stuck with it. I still don't like the parabens, and won't buy another bottle, but it does work quite well."

"I bought this to replace my regular petroleum jelly that I apply to my hands during winter months so they don't crack and dry out.

"This was another item that I kept hearing wonderful things about but took way to long to try personally.I have curly hair that likes to wrap itself into ringlets and can get very tangled, especially at the base of my neck. Even with leave-in conditioner I have to be very gentle when trying to detangle my hair when I get out of the shower.This brush is very light and gentle, it runs straight through my hair with out pulling or catching, it brushes out tangles/knots very easily.I also like it when my hair is dry, it runs through so lightly that I'm able to brush out tangles without flattening my hair at the scalp, and it doesn't make my hair too frizzy. When you brush out naturally curly hair you basically are producing frizzy hair anyway but this brush is much better than any other brush I've ever tried and I've tried lots.I highly recommend the Wet Brush!"

The greasiness is still prsent but not as bad as it was initially and I really have no problem with the grease factor.

Tip: our dermatologist has always advised us NOT to use our fingernails vigorously when shampooing hair, always use fingertips gently to avoid scalp damage and to minimize premature hair loss (thinning/balding), and dandruff.  Use common sense.>Hair breakage was already minimized with her prior usage of organic shampoo and conditioner so it's difficult to determine whether the CSH conditioner was effective.>We liked this sample and it's easonably priced at $4.22 with free shipping from Amazon; It's only $4.01 with Amazon's \"Subscribe & Save\".Dislikes:>Even though CSH conditioner has \"Nutrium 10\": ten vitamins and nutrients, there are a whole lot of other artificial ingredients including Zinc Sulfate and Lysine HCL.>The conditioner is only the second step of a four step regimen: cleanse, NOURISH, treat, and repair.  The manufacturer obviously advises using ALL of their products within this system over 7 days for best results.>Scent is ok during use but may smell a bit acrid to others.>Strong chemicals that made our hair too dry and scalps itch after one month of use.Overall:My gal still prefers her organic shampoo and conditioner without all those synthetic chemical ingredients.  I still prefer scentless or lightly scented shampoos and conditioners.  Individuals have different types of hair so shampoo and conditioner preferences are highly subjective.  If one has NO problems/sensitivities with artificial ingredients, then this CSH system is certainly worth a try."	"Not entirely natural hair conditioner that's part of a hair care system."	"neutral"

"The Own brand was new to me but I decided to give it a try and to share with my wife.  We currently use a product calledClean & Clear ADVANTAGE 3-In-1 Exfoliating Cleanser.  This product is somewhat similar - it has small grains which are the exfoliating agents.  This product is not irritating to the skin.We both feel that this product does a fair job of cleaning and exfoliating.  It is a non-foaming formula, which is ok unless you are used to something that foams.  One of the claims the packaging makes is that this product is anti-aging.  There are several ingredients which may contribute to this claim, including the ubiquitous smidgeon of shea butter, lippia citriadora (also known as lemon verbena),  pelargonium graveolens  (also known as scented geraniums) and jojoba seed oil.  The anti-aging component comes in part from enhancing collagen levels and strengthening the skin to allow it to retain more moisture.My wife and I both arrived at a similar conclusion for this product.  It cleans, but it doesn't clean as well as we anticipated.  We have since stopped using it and use other products in its place, such asPOND'S Exfoliating Renewal Wet Cleansing Towelettesand the other product I mentioned.  Don't get me wrong - this is a good quality facial cleanser, but we think there are better options out there that leave you with cleaner and better maintained skin."	"Anti Aging Cleanser?"	"neutral"

"I tried this soap based on research I had done online about natural soaps.  This one got high reviews so I thought I would give it a try.  It has a strong, but not heavy lemon scent.  I can smell it in the shower, but it doesn't stay on my skin.  The best thing I love about this soap is that it doesn't leave a residue.  It washes clean from my skin.Some possible cons:*It does have a very yellow rinse.  In other words, the color of the soap is the color that washes down the drain.  This can be a nuisance if you don't rinse it off the side of the tub, as it leaves the yellow color behind.  It washes away well, as it doesn't seem to stain the tub.  It doesn't stain my washclothes either, which is a good thing and I have used a white washcloth with it.*It doesn't seem to last as long as other soaps.  Make sure to keep it in a dish that drains, so that it doesn't sit in water or you won't have it around for long.I personally love it, and the cons I listed above aren't cons to me, but may be cons for someone else so thats why I listed them.

This ultra-light formula deep cleans with purifying grains, then rinses off easily for total skin comfort.&#34; What my son has found Is a mild exfoliant to help scrub away dead cells, one of few body washes I've come across that does. It has a scent, but it is far from overpowering. Develops a decent lather.This is the best He has found so far and He has tried A LOT of body washes.

"This kit comes with a cleansing/application tool, two application heads and two tubes of product. The cleansing tool is powered by two AAA batteries, which are included. The application heads are a cleansing head and a foam buffer thing. The design of the tool is modeled after the Clairsonic, but it does not work like the Clairsonic; on the Olay model the application heads spin, whereas the Clairsonic vibrates at a high frequency. The included products are a daily exfoliating cleanser and a microdermabrasion cream for use twice weekly.I replaced my regular cleanser (Dudu Osun Black Soap) with the daily cleanser for a few days to test it out. I kept the rest of my cleansing routine the same. On the plus side, the cleanser did not cause me to have any break outs or rashes, which has not always been the case with Olay Pro-X products. On the down side, my skin's oil production went completely out of control. My face looked and felt greasy all the time. I never have this problem with my regular cleanser.The microdermabsion cream is similar to the Olay Regenerist microdermabrasion system, but it is an all in one product and is not quite as strong. It does an okay job of exfoliating, but nothing really impressive. The Regenerist kit is much better, imo.As for the hand tool, I prefer the Clairsonic. I realize that it isn't really fair to compare them, since the Clairsonic is several hundred dollars and has years of improvements behind it, but I think if Olay is going to design something that looks so much like the Clairsonic, they have to expect comparisons. I always wondered if the Clairsonic would work better if the heads spun, and now I know; the answer is \"no.\" The spinning head doesn't seem to provide any more benefit than scrubbing with my fingers. In fact, my fingers do a better job. The head stops if you apply very much pressure. Also, if I am in an area that is near my hairline, the spinning head rips hairs out.So, my overall take on this is: The microdermabrasion cream is okay, but the Regenerist is better and that is where I would spend my money.

"Dermagen patches adhere and re-adhere as advertised, and I love them except for the shapes (triangle). This set comes in 3 different sizes. I can only use large triangle between my brows, the other two are very small.  Even medium one is too narrow, and doesn't restrict muscle movement which is exactly what you are looking for - not to be able to frown! They are also soft and pliable. I find that inflexible frownies are much better particularly for those deep furrows between the eyebrows. I will have to double them up, not a good deal at this point even if they were $5. I don't have problems reusing them several times so that's the plus. The smallest triangle is too small for anything but can be used on pimples. These do reduce  blemishes overnight.I have purchased Dermagen's new Expression set (triangle), it's more expensive, contains more patches but they are all the same size as these. Big mistake!! I will keep buying and using crescent shapes, but won't be ordering triangle sets unless the seller redesigns (the shape of a medium triangle is perfect, it needs to be 1/2  larger and firmer). I would not recommended these."	"Good patches? Yes! Shapes? Not so much!"	"bad"
"I recommend it to all my gfs and they always fall head over heels for this product.

And great price for the quality and content size!"	"I love this lotion- smells and comfort, yet not sticky"	"good"
"L'Oreal Concentrated Lash Boosting Serum is a new product from the French cosmetics giant that claims to be a breakthrough in promoting natural lash health. It is their first eyelash serum, and they claim it will fortify, nourish, and strengthen lashes with daily use. L'Oreal claims it will strengthen lashes for 24 hours if applied in the morning before mascara - although you must allow this product to dry before applying mascara; and in the evening to clean lashes, after makeup has been removed.  The firm states that the product contains a unique pro-keratin complex of fortifying amino acids, and panthenol. The company also states that this product has been ophthalmologist and allergy tested, and is suitable for sensitive eyes and contact lens wearers.As a younger woman, I used to have a nervous habit of pulling out my eyelashes, as a result of which my upper eyelids have been almost bare of lashes: and I think that, in addition, older women just naturally may lose their lashes. Every now and then, I would use expensive, French, Talika products that were then the only eyelash help available: they are old products, dating from World War II, when they were developed to help flyers with serious burns, and I found they did help slightly. So as soon as Latisse was introduced, I did rush off to get some from my dermatologist. And my eyelashes did, indeed, quickly start to grow longer and fuller. I was thrilled. But there are problems with Latisse. You must get it by prescription, from a dermatologist. It is very expensive, $100 for a small bottle. It is awkward to apply, with those silly little brushes. Worse yet, it made my eyelids red, and they stung - I was looking forward to finishing the little bottle, and ending the treatment. And then, worst of all, I discovered that, like Rogaine, you could only keep the eyelash regrowth by continuing to apply the product every other night forever. And that I was totally unwilling to do, as it would cost both a lot of money and some discomfort. So I watched the regrowth fade away.Obviously, therefore, I was more than ready to try this new L'Oreal product.  I believe I have seen some improvement, as does a younger friend who independently decided to try it at the same time as me; we've had a conversation about it. Needless to say, it is much cheaper and easier to get hold of than Latisse.  It is much easier to apply than the Latisse, as it comes with a patent pending nice soft curved applicator, similar to a mascara wand.I am not experiencing quite as much of the redness, or stinging, of my eyelids that I did with the Latisse, although I am still experiencing discomfort in the eyelid area: still some redness and swelling, caused either by this serum or the mascara that accompanies it in this clever dual product.The accompanying mascara, L'Oreal states, contains hydra-collagen, known for its volume-enhancing properties, and is easily washable.  It does give good results, although, as stated above, am not sure whether the lash serum or the mascara in this product, or both, are causing the irritation of my eyelids.

Don't use a lot of this lotion on your face because it will make your face feel extremely sticky and weird. I used a small amount last night and my face still felt the same way. I don't know how well this product will work, maybe I just have to get used to it, but as of right now I am not liking it too much. It also doesn't smell very pleasant."

"I've tried and liked the Clear Shampoo, but this Conditioner was a bit disappointing to me.  I've tried 2 of the conditioners for their line so unfortunately I think this for me is not an issue with a specific conditioner from Clear, but their line as a whole.  It just didn't leave my hair as soft and silky as what I'm accustomed to. It felt wiry and dry the day I wash it.  In fact, I was convinced for awhile that perhaps I actually had two bottles of shampoo in my shower instead of shampoo and conditioner.  Basically it leaves my hair feeling as if I never conditioned at all.  To make sure it wasn't my hair that changed I tried two different shampoo/conditioner pairs -one from Pantene and one that was a macadamia oil shampoo/conditioner and immediately my hair looked healthier and felt more like what I expected.  It is possible that if I used the shampoo and conditioner from Clear in the summer time when my hair and skin is naturally less dry the results would have been better.  But since 2 of their conditioners have left my hair feeling straw likeI'm also not a huge fan of how this product smells.  To me it has an overpowering floral scent.  But this is also a matter of personal preference.  I like things that are more subtle in nature or are unscented.  It's too bad because I do like what the shampoo does for my dry and sensitive scalp, but I miss how soft and silky other conditioners make my hair feel.  That said there is one plus in that using the Clear shampoo and conditioner together I seem to notice less oil and build up when I wait a few days before washing my hair again.  I do appreciate that since I have sensitive skin and try not to shampoo and condition my hair everyday.  However it is a bit disappointing that in order to get there I have to deal with dry feeling hair the first day my hair is washed."

"I received defective plates. The edge designs on every plate will not transfer because of being too shallow and warping on the backing. I have been trying since late February to resolve this issue. I followed the instructions on the insert that came with the plates, asking me to email them with any issues and they would help. No reply. Facebook commented them. They deleted it. Facebook messaged. They ignored it. I just now opted to ask a question on how to get resolution, literally begging them to help. They deleted it immediately. So here is my review. The designs are amazing. Shame they don't work. I am a pro stamper, over 2 years experience, and am not one to leave negative reviews. I am nothing but satisfied with all of the other companies, and was very excited about this one. I am very disappointed, very let down, and stuck with 35 dollars wasted on useless plates. I wanted the other set, thankfully I didn't order both at the same time as I planned. I will contact amazon with my issue from this point. Buyer beware. Some people are happy with theirs, some have same problem I do. Read all reviews, be advised. Wish I would have."	"Ignored all communication and deleted my question"	"bad"

"I've been using this oil since April, but didn't write a review because I just couldn't figure this oil out.  Now, after 4 months of use, I have.  It's a GREASY, HEAVY oil.The main thing I don't like about this oil is, it just \"sits\" on top of my skin.  My skin does not absorb this oil.Some people say this product gives their skin a \"glow\".  Frankly, I don't like my face greasy and shiny -- yuck!I suppose if you have super dry skin, this might be something good to put on your face. But it's not for me.BTW, someone said they liked the fragrance.Mine smells like Black Seed Oil. Ugh!UPDATE: 11-03-13Went into my beauty stash, and applied this because I hadn't used it in while.  I'd FORGOTTEN about this review.Anyway, this stuff is way too greasy for me!  Made my face break out.  It's a very Heavy OIL.Might be good as an under eye wrinkle treatment -- or for feet or elbows, but I will not put this on my face again."	"HEAVY!"	"neutral"
"Pros:- Does not sting.- Might be good for beginners since it takes the glue a while to set.Cons:- The bond only last for 2-3 days.- Takes about 5 seconds to set so you have to hold the lash in place for that long.  That is a really long time to keep your hand steady.- The glue becomes thick and gummy like after a while so I can't do a full set with one dollop.  I'll have to do a total of three dollopsI am currently using Blink and LOVE it!!!!  It stings quite a bit but the glue is absolutely amazing so far.  It was so much easier to use than this one since it set so quickly.  I places the lash and didn't have to hold it in place.  It set right away and so far I haven't had any fall off yet (although I just tried it last night).  With this particular glue, by the next day, I'll have some lashes already fall off.Hope this helps"	"OK since it doesn't sting but the bond doesn't last long"	"bad"
"Let me first start off by saying (like many others) that I have tried almost every single acne product out there, from Retin A to Proactive, to Salicylic acid, to Oxy pads to Clearasil and nothing has ever worked. My doctor told me the only thing that would ever \"cure\" acne is Acutane, which I did not want to use.  I have used products containing benzoyl peroxide before, but have only used facial treatments containing up to 5%.  When I came across the 10% bar and all the positive reviews that came with it I thought I'd give it a shot.  Yes, it is drying. Yes, you do need to use a moisturizer. Yes, it is working!!!  I use this bar in the morning and at night and although my face isn't totally clear,  within the first week of using I have noticed a big difference. I hope it continues to make my face even more happier as time goes by!---------------UPDATE 1/7/13This is probably the most effective product I've used in over 10 years. Helps clear blemishes and manage skin tone. I use it once a day and gone though almost 3 bars since my original review, so it does last awhile. Hope they continue to keep this product on the market."	"So far, so good!"	"good"
"This device feels very light and flimsy. I expected something with a bit of weight to it, though I suppose if you are holding it up to your face for 20 minutes at a time you my want something light. I like that it has 3 different color heads for different problems. I've used the blue light on my face but noticed very minimal improvement. I've used the red light on my foot that has plantar fasciitis and my doctor said it might help increase blood flow to the area. I guess the biggest drawback of this device is the time commitment to using it, especially if you have more than one area to work on. It does get rather warm too as its working."	"Seems kinda cheap"	"neutral"
"the first few seconds you think,, oh this works great as the product , as their whole line smells amazing. However once you put any kind of make up over it, even after letting it dry and only padding it in the skin, it's like nothing ever happened.For this price I stick to the less expensive products from Roc and L;oreal that seem to even show for a few hours a bit of a better affect."

"Many reviewers say this shampoo is very harsh and that it damages your hair. If you only use this shampoo once a week and follow it up with the right routine, it does WONDERS and works amazingly well as a clarifying product.I would suggest either following this shampoo up with the apple cider vinegar rinse initially suggested by one reviewer, or to incorporate a deep hydrating mask into your weekly routine. I use a deep hydrating mask from the base of my head down to the roots of my hair once a week after using this shampoo.... The result is amazingly soft and supple hair, at least for me, and especially since the clarifying shampoo removes any gunk that may prevent any moisturizing products from penetrating the hair follicle.I would also recommend \"shocking\" the roots of your hair with icy cold water immediately after your shower, in order to ensure your roots are sealed. It sort of helps to counteract the damaging effects hot water could be causing for your hair.This system has works very well for me and my boyfriend compliments how soft my hair is all the time. :)"	"Very Effective, Doesn't Have to Be \"Harsh\""	"good"
"While this item came intact and well-packaged (unlike the thermal mask and eye cream that came pre-opened and used), it does have an unusually thick and gooey consistency, so I've had to dilute it by mixing it with the moisturizer in my hand before application... Even though this product brand sells for way less on Amazon than in their boutiques, the quality is highly inconsistent. You can get pre-opened and used stuff, or maybe &#34;expired&#34; items that have been sitting around for too long. I guess you do get what you paid for!"

"As the title suggests, I'm not super happy with these &#34;shears.&#34;  I would say most craft scissors would do a better job of cutting hair.

"I have very sensitive skin. Nearly anything can cause me to break out into some rash or another. This product, fortunately, does not. It cleans without over-drying, and rinses clean. The gel is viscous enough that when you put a glob on your hand, it sits right there instead of vanishing in the wet of the shower. It makes a nice, smooth lather with little effort.I wouldn't quite call it refreshing, though. It's unperfumed, having only a slight, vague odor that i associate with the bubble soap i used as a kid.I alternate using this withSimple Smoothing Facial Scrub, since i've been told one shouldn't use an exfoliating scrub every day."	"Cleans well, good on sensitive skin"	"good"
"I would prefer an unscented sunscreen myself, but I've gotten used to wearing sunscreens with a subtle bit of coconut or other such tropical scent.  However, Banana Boat for Men is not subtle in the least.  It has a fairly powerful cologne scent to it, which is exactly what I *don't* want 90% of the time I am wearing a sunscreen.The application of the product is fine, and at SPF 30 this will work for me (some may want stronger protection like an SPF 50).  But really, if I want to smell like this while out in the sun I'll use some unscented sunscreen and then borrow the boy's Axe products.  No thanks.Note that I am giving this product three stars overall - four stars for those who want to smell like they're going out on the town while cutting the grass or laying on the beach, and two stars for the rest of us."

"I used WEN Cleansing Conditioner for about four or five months, but moved on to another product when I realized my colored hair was not as conditioned as it needs to be.  Here are my thoughts:1. I have dry hair but an oily scalp.  While I didn't have to use nearly the suggested amount on the bottle to clean it (I think for my long length, they recommend 24 pumps), I did have to use six to eight pumps.  I can't imagine how quickly I would go through a bottle using the recommended amount!2. I was fascinated that it cleaned my hair, but it actually wasn't as moisturizing as the thick, emollient consistency suggested.  I guess, given that it's basically just a fancy 2-in-1 shampoo (which don't moisturize nearly as well as stand-alone conditioners), it makes sense.  This left my hair increasingly dry and dull.  I actually had to use a leave-in conditioner on my hair after washing it with this product.3. I hated the fact that the pump quit working when there was well over a quarter of the product left in the bottle.  I understand the pump not working on the last few ounces, but come on!Surprise, surprise... I didn't get the results promised in the infomercial (which, by the way, I didn't see until after I purchased the product elsewhere).  I don't care how conditioner-like the consistency, this is just an over-hyped 2-in-1 shampoo/conditioner.  If you don't have over-processed hair like mine and just want light conditioning, this will work for you.  But so will the sulfate-free shampoos and conditioners in your corner drugstore."	"Nothing special.  It cleans and lightly conditions."	"neutral"
"I bought this to use it to straighten and style my wavy hair instead of using my flat iron hoping it would cause less damage. This thing is a waste of time and doesn't give you the results. It pulls on your hair and causes them to break. It doesn't provide enough heat to style your hair either. I returned mine and would not recommend it."	"This thing is a waste of time and doesn't give you the results"	"bad"
"This is a nice palette to have if you want to have a lot of colors available and don't want to spend a ton. It's not of the highest quality, but it's definitely not bad either. Most of the shades are very nicely pigmented and not too dry. Some are a bit powdery. You get a great variety of shades. Most of them are matte but there are some shimmer shades. Really great to have around for times when you want to do a bold look. Great value for the price!"	"Pretty nice"	"good"
"I'm no beauty expert, make up pro or anything like that. I'm just a chick trying out new products, techniques and applications so I hope my list of pros and cons can help at least a little.Pros:*Great price. If you're looking for a cheaper version of a beauty blender this is a good start (in my opinion). If you're new to these kinds of sponges like I am, you're not wasting a ton of money if you don't end up liking the coverage or feel of application. If you use one of them and don't like it, you could gift the other three!*There's 4 of them! If your cat steals one as a toy or something you'll have a back up (haha)*These arrived way before the date that was estimated*Love that there are 2 different shaped sponges*Very light, even coverageCons:*These things are smelly! Seriously! I've used them multiple times, washed them with different soaps in hopes the rubbery foam smell would go away but to no avail. I can smell the sponge's scent on my face hours after application*I can't get the stains out of them, not that it matters really, they just look dirty even after washing*Maneuvering around my under eye was a little difficult. I actually think it did more damage than good in that department because my yellow concealer (to counteract dark circles) seemed to disappear no matter what I did with the spongeTips:*Hold under warm water to expand the sponge before use. It will absorb the water and NOT your liquid foundation like those little white wedge sponges everyone used back in the day*Youtube videos for using these little guys if you haven't already, you'll learn all sorts of tricks (like rolling the sponge at the hairline to blend without completely covering your hair in foundation)Even though I, personally, am not totally sold on the sponge application method I would still recommend these over the white wedges. If only someone could tell me how to get rid of the smell, I would rate these a lot higher!"	"Stinky little things!"	"neutral"

"From the description of this product, I was expecting something that worked better than the average cleansing brush on the t-zone, nose and chin areas. Unfortunately, I found this brush to be cumbersome, somewhat uncomfortable to use and inevitably ineffective. The entire brush vibrates, but the rubber bristles themselves don't move or rotate as with Oil of Olay's Cleansing Brush so I didn't find it to work well at cleansing. The awkward shape didn't work well in the places it was said to, like the corner of the nose and face. I find a cleansing pad (like a Buf-Puf) to be far easier (not to mention much cheaper) to use. The liquid cleanser didn't come with the product so I had to use another brand, but I doubt that would affect my opinion because the brush design just didn't work for me."

"St. Ives has been around for a while. I trust their products, but don't expect it to get rid of all your blemishes and acne. I would recommend with people with bad acne to try separate products at a time so their skin won't get too used one product and stop working. Benzoyl peroxide at some nights, and a moisturizer during the day with SPF. and if your using scrubs, don't scrub too hard or you will cut your skin. mix it up and match every now and then. Proactive works too."	"haven't used it much, and i got two..."	"neutral"

"This shampoo comes in a nicely designed bottle. It looks much better than the standard Selsun Blue or Head & Shoulders. It's a white, creamy shampoo with a nice light scent. Unfortunately it seems to make hair a little flat with a residue build-up in hard water. It also had a slightly unpleasant tingling/burning sensation that I didn't like.

"Well, this was my first purchase of a full body tanning lotion with DHA in it... and I'm generally pleased! To be fair, I'm very pale naturally, and I'd been tanning in a level 3 bed for about two months before I purchased this lotion; I had a pretty dark base anyway. I've used this lotion twice in a level 1 and haven't noticed a huge color difference. Perhaps I need to use it a bit more--maybe a higher level bed would do it.I will say that I'm happy I haven't noticed any unfortunate orangey tones or streaks on my naturally cool, pink toned skin. The lotion is thicker than, say, the Supre Sweet & Sexy lotion with natural bronzers. I prefer thicker lotions to thinner ones, myself. This lotion has the usual Sweet & Sexy scent, kind of a sweet sugary musk, and the same ATO that I affectionately refer to as 'pencil shavings-y.' If this lotion had a shimmer in it, I might offer another star."	"Bronzing lotion? OK!"	"good"
"I am used to Moroccan Oil, but I figured I would give this a try.  I found out that this product is heavy on my hair.

Other than that, I am going back to MO."	"Im not sure about this one"	"neutral"
"This is pretty hard to use but it does a good job.  This reason I gave it only one star is because of the location of the on/off and the heat adjuster buttons.

I'm not sure if it does shrink my pores or just fill them up. I do see smaller pores when I'm using this gel. It also reduces the redness on my face.

"I bought this sunscreen as I thought CeraVe was a reputable company.It says SPF50.My face was white as a clown after I used this product. It does not get absorbed by the skin but stays on topof your skin and STAYS WHITE.I looked ridiculous.Rather spend the money on another TERRIFIC product which so far I have only been able to purchase on Amazon,Blue Lizard Sport. It is the same price as Cerave and the WHITE mask disappears after a few minutes.It works great.I purchased the CeraVe because if it had worked, it was more readily available (in stores) than the Blue Lizardline. I learned my lesson."	"Nothing INVISIBLE about this sunscreen"	"bad"
"I color my hair allot mostly something in the red family, well red fades fast and of course it not healthy to color every-time I fell like so I was happy to try this color enhancer/extension from John Frieda. I have only tried the one bottle but I notice enhanced shine, and a slower fading of my salon color. So if you want hold on to that color or stay close to it give this a try...it is not a hair dye it merely works with what you have already."	"Great potential.."	"good"

It is super cheap so I guess not too much lost."	"not impressed"	"bad"
"My pallete arrived intact and I really love it. The colors are bright and shimmery (a lot of neutrals too though). These colors look really beautiful on all skin tones, but I love to use them on tanner skin because the colors really pop. The way the pallete folds into itself is great for storage and travel. I also like the fact that there is a little mirror on it. For 96 colors, its a great bargain."	"Love this Pallete!"	"good"
"The spf lotion goes on super white, even though it's supposed to be tinted. Made me look like a ghost and didn't smell very good. Didn't go on easily either. The facial wash is really nice, smells good, and has lasted a long time. It doesn't foam up, so don't expect it to."	"Good soap, yucky lotion."	"neutral"

"I ordered this to try because most body washes irritate and dry  my super-sensitive skin.  This does the trick, it is very mild, and cleans without leaving your skin with that tight stripped feeling.  Nice, effective product at a good price. It is not heavily scented or as fancy as some other body washes, no bright colors or gritty beads, just a light natural scent (no added fragrance, which is  a big deal because fragrance is a major cause of allergic reactions) and an effective gentle body wash.  I highly recommend it, especially if you have sensitive skin."	"Very gentle, good for sensitive skin"	"good"

You notice a difference immediately with this treatment mask. I usually leave it on for about 10 minutes, and I use it every other day. It doesn't build up in your hair or make it oily. It DOES moisturize the scalp and decrease flaking significantly (if the flaking is due to dry scalp). I love this product and won't hesitate to buy it when it runs out."

"Applied nicely, but did not have the look one would expect from a good concealer. There is a shine to this product that is not helpful when you are trying to cover up something -- it draws attention to it instead. In view of the fact that there are so many other really excellent products out there to do the job right, I'd recommend that you pass on spending your hard earned cash on Revlon Photoready Concealer.This was a surprising disappointment because the Revlon Photoready Primer is FABULOUS, and I've gotten tons of compliments since I've started using it."

"I would not buy this liquid liner again.  I do like that it is waterproof, but I do not like that I have to apply, and reapply it several times before I can get it right.  I am used to being able to use an eye liner brush to smudge, and blend, or correct the line on my upper lid, and you can not do this with this eye liner.  If you do not like how you applied the line, it will flake off, yes, peel, and flake off, and you will need to start again.  But, once you get it how you want, it does stay.  I would not buy this liquid liner again though."	"Would not buy again"	"neutral"

I have been suffering with dry itchy eyes, blurred vision (but only sometimes) and eyes so red I am afraid that my students will accuse me of smoking a joint before class!I tried the homeopathic remedy of watered down baby shampoo and that didn't do anything.Then I tried these and my eyes felt so much better within days!  When I ran out of them, I tried going back to the baby shampoo while I was waiting for my next shipment with no luck.Then I received my shipment and discovered I have order the regular Ocusoft lid scrubs and those BURNED my eyes so bad i returned them.  So I am back to the Lid scrub Plus and I will probably never stop using it again."	"Awesome for ocular rosacea!"	"good"

"I was a bit disappointed with this eye mask. Though it is soft and big enough to cover my eyes, it is very lightweight and fits loosely. My wife says that she doesn't like this because when she wants to take a quick nap during the day she likes eye masks that have a tighter fit and feel snug and keep out all light. No matter how tightly you pull the Velcro, you can still see out from the bottom. Unfortunately, this just wasn't the item for us."	"Too loose for us!"	"neutral"
"I am very upset with this order.  I got an sample and like the eye cream and ordered from Amazon.com to try to save money.  The user reviews on this product on Amazon.com were good.  However, the product from Amazon.com smelled differently from the sample I got from a salon.  I thought this is from Amazon.com so it should be reliable and just put up with the bad smell.  Even though the product also felt different on,  At the beginning, other than the smell, it seemed O.K..  However, my eyes (or skin around the eyes) then got puffy and itching and peeling after a week or so.  Initially, I was not sure why the skins around my eyes were itching as I often have allergies during summer when flowers are blooming.  I then stop using it and everything is fine now.  The peeling and itching were terrible -- I have never had such reaction to ANY eye creams!  I just wasted $40 and suffered the irritations -- I suspect Amazon.com got the product from a \"fake\" source.  However, I don't want to go to the salon to get the \"real\" one now as I don't want to risk to have the bad reaction again."	"Seem Not the same product"	"bad"
"It dries well on my skin and doesnt leave a sticky sensation. The SPF is not high, I wish they had a SPF 30 or more version, but probably would be sticky...

"All family members tried this.  Except for my husband, we - male & female, all have long hair.  We did not like it for long hair.Pros-Smells fresh - has a nice green/slightly fruity smell.  Scent is not overly strong once hair dries.-Effective anti dandruff ingredient that has worked well for us-Relieves itching, lessens flakes-Good price on a generous amount-lathers well IF hair is very wet-cleans effectively-works very well for short hair that is in good condition-does not weigh hair downCons-tangles long hair-leaves dry or long hair feeling like it has not been conditioned when used by itself-does nothing to smooth hair - leaves fly aways and frizzies.There's better alternatives out there.  Clear makes a great anti-dandruff that isn't so harsh on the hair.  It's a bit more, but I much prefer it.We found that we we definitely had to use conditioner with this product, though it is advertised as a 2 in 1.  I also had to use smoothing serum.  It seemed to strip my hair.  I'd probably still use it now and then because it seemed to act as a clarifier to remove built up hair product.  My main criticism is not that it doesn't get hair clean, it's just a bit too harsh for our long hair."	"There's conditioner in this?  Maybe not for LONG hair..."	"neutral"

"I purchased this set a couple of weeks ago.  Everything in the package is as pictured...I just doubt that the brushes will last long, the set seems to not be very durable.  First, when I opened the pouch for the first time, the flap covering the brushes was sticking to the handles.  So much so that when I peeled it open, a portion of the paint or covering of the brush handles was stuck to the pouch!  The handles of the brushes were then marked slightly.  Then, after using one of the brushes with polish, I grabbed some remover on a cotton ball and was swabbing it clean.... and the BLACK PAINT on the handles came off onto the cotton ball (and my fingers)!!!The brushes look and function as intended...but whomever designed this set should have used other materials for the handles.  The black painted finish is not practical."	"Not Ideal"	"neutral"
"Honestly, I saw no difference in my hair or my nails as stated in the product discription. And I actually seem to lose MORE hair. I have used hair strengthening products in the past with great success (shampoos & conditioners) but I thought I would try a &#34;vitamin&#34; to boost the length and volume of my hair (it's thinning out from age and stress :)  Anyway... I don't know if I was getting too much biotin (as I do take a daily vitamin, eat right, etc) or if I was stressed and no amount of supplement could help me at the time. But I took the entire box and still no difference. I can't recommend this product."	"Honestly, I saw NO difference and in fact..."	"bad"
"I thought this would be bigger, but honestly it works great! I usually use cotton pads or balls to apply glycolic or lactic acid peels, but this is what I needed and didn't even know it. I put a tiny amount of product in a bowl, use this brush to apply it evenly and thinly to my face. It is very easy to use and really prevents mess and drip. It spreads the product out as it should, and helps to both conserve the product and to apply it evenly to all areas. I wish I had figured out earlier that I needed it! A must have for anyone administering peels at home."	"Great applicator"	"good"
"This is a basic moisturizer that gets the job done.  I wasn't a big fan, since I have skin that is oily in places and dry in places and this seemed to make everything oily.  My wife stole this from me and has been using it every day, however her skin isn't quite as oily.  It absorbs quickly and is not scented, although I did notice a light lotion smell, it was not obnoxious. I would not buy again for myself, but I would think that people with normal skin would like this.  It might be to light for dry skin."	"Does the job"	"neutral"
"I was so excited to try this, ive heard such wonderful things about charcoal. It was alright, it felt good on my skin, i like it as a cleanser. Then i started breaking out like crazy. I dont know if it was the charcoal bringing all the bad stuff to the surface but once i stopped using it and started using the biore ice cleanser my skin started to clear up. Now that the large pimples on my forehead and sides of my face have subsided im afraid to pick this back up and give it another try."	"ehh"	"bad"
"A very tight pony tail can cause hair damage and lead to traction alopecia.  This coated elastic creates a relatively loose ponytail so it does not damage hair yet stays on pretty well. When I want a tighter grip on my hair I use two of them at a time. The grip is still not too tight, yet stays on all day without adjusting.The ends of the elastic are glued together, there are no metal connectors between the edges.  Another good thing for your hair!  However, over time the glue does loosen.  This not unreasonable, just normal wear which is expected.These elastics can be used for things other than hair too! They are more attractive than rubber bands and don't break from sun exposure like rubber bands.  So I found a number of non-hair uses for them. Here are two example: (1) I use them to keep label's on home-made jams that I give as gifts; (2) When I take portrait photos I sometimes use a piece of nylon stocking instead of filter to provide a softening effect on the faces (hides fine wrinkles), I use this elastic to hold the nylon square over my lens.Good stuff at a reasonable price, you can't go wrong!Ali Julia review"	"Good stuff at a reasonable price, you can't go wrong!"

"The product isn't bad but the packing is deceiving as far as the amount you get and the dropper doesn't get the last of it from the bottom, at this price I want every last drop. Just not as consumer friendly as a similar product from watts beauty."	"Needs to be repacked. Dropper sucks."	"neutral"

My hair has just enough natural waves to make my thick hair get very 'big' if I don't condition and straighten this.  I have tried numerous heat protecting products , and straightening aids, and I am not a fan of this Tresemme spray.  I think it actually stopped me from getting the straight look I normally have.  I also felt my looked dull and lacked movement.  Sorry to say this is not for me, because I usually like their other products."	"Not for me"	"bad"
"I've read some reviews complaining about eh size of these fimo canes, but in the product description it does say the canes are an inch long so you shoudn't be surprised. When opening this product there is no organization its just a box of canes, not plastic or anything. Yes the blade is in there randomly but it is covered by a cardboard sheet. You wouldnt hurt yourself if you didn't open the package so recklessly. I did not get all the images shown in the products pictures, i got some different ones but thats okay. I did get one pair of duplicates in this item. Something that made me have to give this product 4 stars was one of the canes i got was not even half an inch long . It was my strawberry fruit Fimo cane. sad. Other than those two disappointments this product is priced expensively in comparision to other fimo canes. Positves of this product is that there is lots of variety and anyone can have fun slicing fimo canes. Doing this is way more exciting (and sometimes cheaper) than buying the pre cut fimo! I will Post images of The box in comparision to my hand, what it looked like when opened and the half inch mishap."	"Lots of variety"	"good"

"This is probably one of the best chemical sunscreens I've tried however having sensitive skin, I needed something with more physical sunscreen ingredients in it such as titanium dioxide and zinc oxide. This does have a little bit of zinc oxide in it however it is mostly chemicals. I'm hoping Cerave will come out with a 'sensitive skin' version without the chemicals in the future?That said, for the price, this is really good sunscreen if you are okay with the chemicals as it also has skin healing ingredients in it so you are getting some benefit while wearing it all day.Also it is not greasy/shiny at all and leaves a nice matte finish. It also has a bit of a scent but not much so that is fine.The price is quite good as well."	"Great chemical sunscreen but I wish it had more physical sunscreen ingredients"	"neutral"
"The Olay Total Effects 7-in-1 Moisturizer was a disappointment. I found the cream to be heavy and greasy, and didn't absorb into my skin well at all. Additionally, the added sunscreen/SPF gave it that dreaded slippery texture and heavy feelingon the skin. It did little to mitigate seasonal dryness, and left my skin too shiny to properly apply makeup.Not a very good product, and did not meet my needs."	"Overhyped and Overpriced"	"bad"
"This is amazing, just smelling it in the store does it no justice!!! Took it home and it's just amazing the smell is wonderful, just like I remember and the fact that it says it gives your hair shine without silicones is ALSO AWESOME. It lathers VERY well and feels sooooo soft on your hair! It's also paraben free!HERBAL essences came back to their senses and are selling two of their older collections again. I stopped using Herbal essenses years ago when they switched formulas and made HERBAL essence SMELL LIKE HEAVY PERFUME, FRUIT and CANDY NOT HERBAL scented at all. Now that they are back, I'm a returning customer, should they pull this off the shelf again, I am GONE.Smells great, works well, I LOVE THE OLDER bottles too it's much easier to get the product OUT of the container, I cant tell you how crappy the \"new\" tops are that dont open until you've broken a finger off."	"THANK GOD THEY CAME TO THEIR SENSES!!!"	"good"
"I was really hoping this would work well as my hair is damaged from swimming.  But putting it on, it's very heavy (a positive) with a feel like vaseline.  It felt great as I let it sit and did my nails.  But once I washed it out (which took awhile), the softness lasted long enoough to comb out but there were still tangles.  Once I did a blow dry on it, it only felt marginally different from before.It's as if all the conditioning power went down the drain.  I tried it again with not rinsing all of it out, leaving a bit in, and that was a greasy disaster.I think part of the problem is that it promises in the ad and on the label to do virtually everything, instead of doing one thing really well.  I wouldn't buy this, I would likely go forTresemme Platinum Strength Deep Conditioning Treatment, 6 Ounceinstead."	"felt silky while in use, not so much after"	"neutral"

"Firstly, let me tell you why I originally bought this lipstick in 'Pink Pout', then I'll review the lipstick in its own right. I'll also rate it based off the lipstick itself and not what I was hoping for, because after all this is a review on the product and not meant to be viewed solely as a \"how does it compare?\"So basically, I'm a bit of a makeup junkie. Over the last few years I've hoarded - er, collected - many products. Among those products, I stumbled upon a lipstick that I have loved like no other - MAC's Viva Glam Gaga 1. While I meant to buy a backup, I didn't get around to it before the product had been discontinued and replaced with Viva Glam Gaga 2. Since then, I've been on the hunt for similar colors and dupes of that lipstick. I've found a few... but this is not one of them.While scouring the internet, many people said that this lipsticked topped with a gloss was close to the Viva Glam Gaga 1. I'm here to state the verdict and that is: yes and no. While it is a light baby pink like Viva Glam Gaga, it's not quite the same. It's paler, dustier and flatter looking overall more natural in appearance - which I'm fine with because I do like this lipstick in itself, and it IS a color I think anyone who liked Gaga 1 would like. But it doesn't replace it.As for the actual color/texture/longevity, it's incredibly creamy for a matte. It's very pigmented - while lighter than my natural lip color, it covers them without a liner no problem, and I find the color lasts through general talking/drinking for 2-3 hours before needing to reapply."	"Good lipstick in itself, not so much for the reason I bought it"	"good"
"This soap has some power to it and some grain in it to help exfoliate and clean the skin, but it's got a strong musky smell.When you consider most laundry detergents have smells, soaps, have smells, deodorants have smells, colognes have smells by the end of the day you smell like the Bath and Body Shop at the mall.Give us a great soap for men that cleans, exfoliates, and leaves no residue and no smell."	"Great soap, but why do men's soaps have to smell musky?"	"neutral"
"I really wanted to like this product for a few reasons. I like to use natural products and the reviews on here lead me to believe that it would work in exfoliating as well as moisturizing. That is in fact the point of an in shower body scrub (exfoliating) right? Wrong. I saw no benefit to using this scrub. It leaves your skin oily, I would not call this moisturized, and I have skin that accumulates gunk very easily as I have naturally oily skin so for anyone who has similar skin I would skip out on this product and go for something natural that actually does the job. Additionally this actually has added to the issue of stuff being in my pores on my back and everywhere because of the \"moisturizing\" effect it has on the skin."	"So Oily!"	"bad"
"I saw some of the reviews and I wasn't sure if I wanted to get this lip lines, however I need it something other than red and pink, so I gave it a go and I am VERY impress, you can use this lip liners with your lipstick- lip gloss or use your lip balm and use them as a filler.They are not creamy so don't except super soft lips BUT they have great color. :-)"	"Amazing colours"	"good"
"TheMotions At Home Moisture Plus Conditioner, 13-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)is a little too heavy for my hair. My hair is a little coarse and thick. But when I used this conditioner, my hair looked like I had never washed it. I tried again, making sure to use less conditioner this time around. Again, my hair was flat and lifeless. The third time I used an even smaller amount and make sure to thoroughly rinse my hair for about 5 minutes (I don't usually rinse my hair that long). The result - my hair was only slightly less lifeless.I imagine this could be a great hair conditioner for somebody else but not for me.Perhaps for the proper person, this conditioner would work wonders. But with my stubborn hair, it just didn't work.Your mileage may vary."	"too heavy"	"neutral"
"The smell is so strong it burns my eyes. I love Freeman's other masks though, I enjoy the clay avocado one a lot and even use the black sugar scrub one to exfoliate. This one doesn't seem to improve my skin or make it look any better after using...it's fun to peel off though."	"Not very useful"	"bad"
"This is a great product.  The Ponds people have been around a long time and they are very reliable.  My wife is the user and she has told me that since she recently had eye lid surgery this is the ideal thing for her face.

"Like everyone else, I had seen the infomercials about Proactiv, but I had read review online about how people said it made their acne worse and that the company is a hassle to deal with. So I didn't bother. However, my mother had seen the same infomercials and decided to get my Proactiv anyways (for the record, she bought it at a kiosk but when she started getting charged for the auto shipments, she promptly returned it...I can't say how easy or difficult it was for her to do it, but we never got anymore shipments after that and I haven't heard her complain about how hard it was to get a refund...so there's that.)Anyways, I put off using Proavtic for a long time, even though my mother was insistent about making me at least try it. So recently, I started using it. I would describe my acne as more than moderate, but definitely less than severe. I use the entire system once day in the morning before I went to school. Instead of experiencing a relief from my acne (or at least no change) it actually made my acne worse. I know it wasn't just \"my skin getting used to the product\", it was legitimately causing pretty bad acne that had never been there before. I only experienced relief when I STOPPED using it. I was then left with more acne than when I started. I have since stopped all usage of Proactiv and now only use baby wash/shampoo until I can fine something else...it's a heck of a lot cheaper, has actually helped to clear my acne and definitely not as harsh as the Proactiv system.So, all in all, I do not recommend Proactiv at all. It's extremely expensive, and does not provide any acne-clearing benefits that couldn't be found in a simple drugstore acne kit."	"Did not work for me at all"	"bad"
"I love this product but it can be purchased in stores as well. I have sensitive skin and this works great."	"Great"	"good"
"In my opinion, this system is just okay. The exfoliating stuff works very well, but for me, it's just more hassle than it's worth. I doubt that I will buy it again, but if you are dedicated to frequent skin care, then I'd recommend it. I'm sure it's as good as any other product on the market, and likely less expensive than the ones you will find at large department stores."	"A lot of work, but not bad"	"neutral"
"This was pretty expensive in my opinion and I did not see accurate results from it. I tried with additional products but my hair always fell flat. Maybe I was not using it correctly but I followed the directions on the bottle so I would not recommend this product."	"Not worth the money"	"bad"
"you can use a small amount great holding and dries quickly. Easy to remove with eye makeup remover, easy to apply."	"Easy to use"	"good"
"My wife was the main user for this product, and liked the feeling, but doesn't think it lives up entirely to the hype.First of all, the packaging was nice, and it was a nice touch that they decided to include batteries.  The cleaning puffs work very well and leave skin feeling fresh.  It is nice that there are different vibration levels, as the highest level felt a bit too much for my wife, but when I tried it was just right for me.  It is a very nice to have this treatment available on a daily basis, which does feel like it cleanses pores and cleans off dry skin.  The only concern my wife raised about the design is that the circular base works well enough but is not easily adaptable to the chin and the upper lips and other curvy areas of the face.Does it really remove wrinkles and age spots?  It may be too soon to tell but after a few weeks it doesn't seem to be making much of a difference.  While it's not magic, the skin rejuvenator does leave skin feeling, well, rejuvenated and fresh.  If nothing else, that's not a bad way to start the day."	"Leaves skin feeling soft, but not necessarily wrinkle free"	"neutral"
"Why does this say it is \"human hair\" when it's not? False advertising. You can't buy a Human hair wig anywhere for $7.00."	"This is not \"human hair\"."	"bad"
"I've been wearing this as long as they've been making it. I only wear clear because I'm very fair complected and color looks weird on me. My lips are small too so I prefer just gloss. It has a very subtle sparkle and will keep your lips conditioned. It's not sticky like so many are. It's very easy to apply while driving or sitting at a light. When I finish a tube, I take an orange stick (for manicures)and scoop the rest out from the base of the tube. Then I put it in a small plastic container. You wouldn't believe how much is left in the base! Probably at least another month of usage."	"I love the clear -  #105!!!"	"good"
"I didn't purchase this from Amazon and am reviewing the product only. The Pureology Hydrate line is definitely top-tier BUT, if you're going to spend this amount on conditioner, I'd suggest sticking with the original Hydrate Conditioner and skip this Hydrate LIGHT conditioner. Both products work well, smell nice, have a great ingredient list but the original/non-light has a great tingle factor that stimulates the scalp. Plus, both products seem to condition the hair the exact same and this one doesn't seem any lighter than the original."	"Stick with the original"	"neutral"
"to big for nail art, but good for other craft. different color than on the picture. But its not bothering me"	"for other craft perfect"	"bad"
"Gelish is the only polish I will ever wear.  2-3 weeks on fingers and I have gone about 7 weeks on my toes before changing colors due to new growth. Perfect for the busy mom who doesn't have time to polish her nails 4 times a week! I use this for french manicures, and it would perfectly.  Very translucent, subtle pink."	"Little Princess"	"good"
"With my very fine and usually limp hair, I'm always searching for a thickening product to add more volume without weighing my hair down or leaving behind any residue. I've been a long time user (and fan) of Pantene shampoos and conditioners, so when I heard about this new product, I had to try it.The product comes out of the bottle similar to hairspray, but has a light, slippery, gel-like consistency. I can't say I liked the alcohol and added fragrance combination. It smelled more perfume-y than clean in my opinion.Like the instructions said, I parted my hair in several places and used a few sprays along each part line. With my medium-length hair, I'd say I used about about 12 or so sprays.I rubbed it throughout my hair, especially toward the root area. It says you can use it on either wet or dry hair. I used it when my hair was freshly washed and combed through.As I blew dried my hair, I could tell it had more substance and volume. It did feel thicker. When my hair was totally dry, it looked visibly thicker, soft and had a nice shape. The only problem was that after a few hours, my hair volume pretty much returned to what it looks like if I don't use any product on it. It also felt a little weighed down and 'crispy' as if I used too much hairspray. The next day, I had to shampoo it twice to rinse the product out before my hair felt clean again.I've tried the spray a few more times since, but I still have the same issues with the volume not lasting long enough, the annoying residue feel and the somewhat overpowering scent. I was really hoping this would be the answer to thicker, fuller hair, but I guess I'll have to keep searching."	"Volume didn't last long enough"	"neutral"
"This review will be very short. My skin is extremely sensitive, but I picked this product (which, to be fair, is not advertised as a product for sensitive skin), because generally Cetaphil has been good for my skin due to its non-comedogenic, oil-free, fragrance-free formulas. This time Cetaphil, unfortunately, let me down. I had an allergic reaction to it immediately after using it for the first time - redness, itchiness, etc. It took almost a week for my skin to heal."	"If you have a very sensitive skin, I would try some other product"	"bad"
"I have been dying my hair for decades and normally, when I try to go to a darker shade it doesn't last long. My hair just doesn't hold dye very well. I used Light Golden Copper and now three weeks later it still looks wonderful. I will definitely be using this stuff from now on."	"Staying power."	"good"
"I have very long curly hair that I blow dry to straighten and then curl with either a 1 1/2 inch Hot Tool curling iron or Conair pink rollers.  I found that after several hours my hair would get fuzzy and not hold curl in an attractive manner.  So don't recommend this for that type of stying.  It is good at keeping flyaways down for half up/bun/pony tail styles."	"Nice Product For Updos"	"neutral"
"I tried using this on my thick, wavy hair, but it did not do a great job of detangling. It got some of the tangles out, but it did not come through smoothly. It felt sticky and gross. The scent is light but unpleasing. I gave my hair a good rinse but it left a residue on my hair. I used up about half of the tub, then gave up on it and threw it away. Not a good conditioner at all."	"Didn't even finish it"	"bad"
"Definitely would recommend these brushes because there is a brush for everything you may need to do makeup. Also it comes in a cute pink case."	"Make brush heaven"	"good"
"I could wear it but it is not that great, maybe I am more modern but this cologne have this old school type, maybe I could have use it back in 2000, or 2005, but right now just don't seem so great, I experienced comments such as smells great, or just blah, that's why the 3 stars, maybe you have friends would will love it, or you are used to this cologne, but for someone who use it for the first time, it is not for me. I hope it does help to know this."	"3 as 50/50"	"neutral"
"This nail art sticker roll was very difficult to use. It wasn't very sticky and it was difficult to unravel. I ended up throwing it away."	"Difficult to use"	"bad"
"I loved this product!  It really helped to rehydrate and smooth my skin.  Ive had a lot of skin damage to my skin and after using this, my skin looks and feels great!  Read my full review at TheBeeHiveBuzz dot com!"	"Great product!"	"good"
"I bought this product to use with my Curlformers and was very disappointed.  My curls fell out by noon, and it made my hair greasy.  I was hoping to use a product with more natural ingredients...which this has...but I will have to keep looking."	"Less than I hoped for..."	"neutral"
"I was SO excited to use these inexpensive caviar beads! I waited weeks for them to arrive (before the estimated delivery date) and I quickly got to work experimenting. I intended to use them in combination with Gelish polish to give them a longer lasting look than the sephora brand method. As soon as i laid them into my gel polish they color started to melt away, it muddied the polish and the destroyed the look. I tried setting the beads in the sticky layer, color melted, i set the beads in a gelish polish layer, color melted, I set the beads quicker and top coated and cured, again melted.I also tried the beads with regular OPI polish with the same result. I guess i could try using them as a scrap book embellishment, but so far I have wasted a few bucks and multiple hours of my time trying to make this happen, If anybody finds a better way, please fill me in!"	"Beads leak color when applied, super unhappy."	"bad"
"I saw this while browsing an Ulta store and the fragrance hooked me! Gosh this rose smell is so beautiful, and the body butter is pretty moisturizing, too (but the butter part is nothing better than anything else I've tried). What really got me was the fragrance. It's so great!"	"Moroccan Rose smells beautiful!"	"good"
"I tried the semi dye, color only lasted 2 weeks. So is this a permanent dye? How long does it last?"	"Permanent dye?"	"neutral"
"It was so light and I use it for stamping on my nails.  I can't give it a double coat so it didn't do what I wanted."	"horrible"	"bad"
"This is a good choice for hairspray when shine and good hold are the objectives.  I usually prefer a lighter spray, but this works so well I've continued to use it. Amazon has the best price I have found, especially with Prime."	"Good spray"	"good"
"Came in perfect time, none of the bottles were hard to open or came broken, I believe it was also bubble wrapped very well/, I like the colors I tried them out on my fiance's feet minus the solid colors :P haha, they're all very smooth and just great consistency aside from the white .! The white was horrible"	"Okay."	"neutral"
"The hair was very thin, especially the ends. It has a weird smell and texture, and the clips are sewn in very losely, you'll have to re sew them. It's not all human hair, part of mine turned grey when i dyed it black, which then melted when i tried to straighten it. But thats 20 dollar extentions for you."	"Very thin."	"bad"
"I only used this product for a couple months and then I stopped because I was using a Retin-A product prescribed by my dermatologist. I have discontinued use of these types of products because for one I have uneven skin tone and scarring but don't get acne anymore and two I just don't like what is does to your skin (makes it super thin and ultra sensitive) But I am going to purchase this product again and use it for the requiered time because it, unlike most vitamin c products,actually has L-Ascorbic Acid (vitamin C) and not a vitamin c derivitive. You can also tell for how long the product stays potent because the liquid is clear andwhen it loses its potency it becomes  a murky yellow. (most companies make their vit c products yellow already so you can't tell when it goes bad.)"	"Great Company/ Product"	"good"
"Ive been a long time covergirl product girl but decided to give this a try. I dont feel as if it gives enough coverage. Its very light going on and maybe that's why. It just doesnt feel like I have any powder on. I wont be buying this again but Im glad I at least gave it a try."	"I dont like this as much as covergirl"	"neutral"
"very very very bad i cant believe that when read the review teel to my mind this is prefect but i put it in garbage like the food's oil :("	"so bad"	"bad"
"I used the Dead Sea Salt Deep Hair Conditioner following the Dead Sea Salt Shampoo. I was surprised at how nicely this conditioner softened my hair and helped it dry without frizz.  My scalp felt good and I noticed my head did not feel dry anymore. My hair was super easy to style and as I continued to use it I noticed my scalp felt healthier with the combination. The winter was so long and dry I actually was experiencing flaking which was unusual for me. I noticed the flaking has stopped and my scalp looks good. I will continue to use both the shampoo and conditioner since it works well for me."	"I really like this Dead Sea Salt Deep Hair Conditioner"	"good"
"It's okay about sums it up...I really can't say that I have fewer fine lines but i have tried a lot and I mean a lot of products and this one is so reasonably priced and does about the same thing they all do...very little.."	"it's okay"	"neutral"
"This might be a good product but is a crazy small size for the price.  This will last me only a few uses.  I appreciate organic but need to have a good value in products that I buy.  I should've been more careful reading the description when I ordered."	"Size is very small."	"bad"
"I love the Harmony Gelish polishes and use them exclusively now.  It's a bit of an investment to get the base and top coats and the UV lamp, but do it!  It's so worth it!  This is a perfect hot pink color with a very subtle silver shimmer to it."	"Great hot pink color"	"good"
"I bought this for cowashes. I wanted a cheap conditioner for this job. I am natural and it does the good. i love the smell too."	"IT'S OKAY"	"neutral"
"I really like the IBD products because they are good quality, great price, and the bottles are much larger than their more expensive counterparts.But after using this basecoat, my daughter and I both discovered that the polish started peeling off after about 5 days.  My daughter used it first and I thought she just had \"oily nails\", but when I finally used it, the same thing happened.  The top coat and polish are okay because I'd used them many times; it's just the basecoat."	"Changing Review - Bad Basecoat"	"bad"
"I'm writing this review having used this product exactly once.  I recall using this type of roller as a child, and struggling to figure it out then.....  I had, on those grounds, rather hoped this would include son instruction sheet for various effects. Sadly, there is only a sentence or two on theback by way of instruction.  However, it wasn't sorely needed (though would be nice!).  Someone recommended securing the rollers to each other to prevent flopping around (or flopping in face).  I also recommend this.  They seen reasonably good quality.  All bent easily and help position easily.  Were simple to use, confytosleep in sndleft me with LOTS of curl and body.  I have waist length fine wavy textures hair (and lots of it!) and I managed withjust one pack of these, however, I think it would be easier with TWO packs and intend to order another. These are 5/8\"in diameter, which is smaller than a small hot roller or standard curling iron. So, theseDO create CURL not \"body.\""	"5/8\" diameter. no complaints (no real instructions included, though)"	"good"
"My skin looks better after just a few days use, but the smell is so bad, I can only use this product at night."	"works great, smells awful"	"neutral"

"THE COLORS ARE BEAUTIFUL AND MATTE.YOU GET ONE SPARKLEY ONE FOR A NICE BRIGHT SHINY HIGHLIGHT!I DO SUGGEST THIS FOR ALL THE PEOPLE WHO LOVE TO KEEP PALETES ON HAND. I CARRY THIS IN MY BAG AND MY ORIGINAL NAKED PALETTE IS HOME :) LOVE IT!"	"AMAZING!"	"good"
"It isn't greasy and I can get dressed immediately after using this lotion.  I think that's the best thing about Suave Moroccan lotion.  I've been using it about a week now, and I can't say my dry skin has healed too much, but I know this takes time.  There isn't much of a scent, which I also like.  it seems a little thin - not creamy, but maybe this is why it absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy remainder on my skin.  I'm not sure if I'd buy it again.  There is really nothing I don't like about it, but I'm used to thicker, creamier lotions."	"Pleasant to use."	"neutral"
"For having a bunch of promises about how well it'll work, this bottle is only about a two-week supply, and it makes no difference in anything--sweat, breath, etc. Save your money and just use perfume and lots of soap and mints!"	"Does NOTHING"	"bad"
"I'm so glad that my Sage Shampoo came safe and on time. i try it out and i just love that fresh scent on Sage. and it don't take much.. just a little drop on to your hands, and you get a great amount to wash your hair. it left my hair feeling so smooth and soft. i will be using more of this and i will post more information after more use of this Shampoo. so far so Good! Try it for yourself! i Dare you! : )  Thanks!"	"Relaxing***~~~***"	"good"
"Great airflow means this works well in drying your hair and it has adjustable speeds which is a plus. As other reviewers have mentioned this feels heavy. I'm not sure if this means it will last longer or not but it's a factor to consider. The grip feels good and I have no complaints except for the weight."	"Great For Drying But A Little Heavy"	"neutral"
"I like the black castor oil alot better than this.  I hardly use this oil, the few times I used it, it dried out my hair."	"It is ok"	"bad"
"Great hydration without the breakouts. Scent is alittle much and may not work for alot of people with allergies to fragrance. They need to make one fragrance free then I would rate it a 5 star."	"ponds dry skin cream"	"good"
"Well I used the yellow shea butter now I am using the ivory shea butter it is ok I like it"	"shea butter"	"neutral"
"It took a full month and a half after ordering this product for it to get to me. By that time, I had just used a regular file and suffered through with those results. Who has time to wait a full month and a half to do their nails? It was ridiculous."	"Terrible Shipping Rate"	"bad"
"10 month update ***Since my last, rave review, I have used the brush several times, but I don't use it as much because it has gotten scratchier, which is suspect. Also a hair falls out every time I use it. Some of my super cheap brushes feel the same. I don't know why this is. It still applies like a dream, but it is slightly more irritating to my sensitive eye area. I see a lot of reviews for various sigma brushes and I get an idea that Sigma brushes 1)should be soft 2) should not shed and be of general high quality. This is a great, useful shape, but some of my $1 brushes haven't even shed this much or gotten this scratchy.Also my uses for this brush have been 1) for cutcrease, although I find using an angled brush is better 2)for under the eyes, when you want a smoked out effect. I usually use a smudge brush, but this gives an even smokier effect. It was really irritating to use in that delicate area today, though. No longer sure this is an essential brush!_____This is probably one of the softest brushes I own, which is crazy because this is a stiff brush! I can't imagine how divine all other sigma brushes are.The pencil brush is for precise application of color and it worked even better that I thought it would. This brush has a nice, long handle and gave me a lot of control over where and how my eyeshadow applied.Honestly, this was just a test to see how Sigma brushes performed (it was Sigma vs. Bdellium and Sigma is, without a doubt, several tiers above all other brush companies at the same price point). I'm really impressed (and very sad for the future of my wallet). I am going to save up for an entire kit!"	"The Sigma Pencil brush is perfection"	"good"
"it doesnt stay cold for very long once out of the freezer.  also the band that goes around your head is thin and weak."	"its ok"	"neutral"
"A total waste of money (though it's pretty cheap). I don't know what the rave with this eye gel is all about. The gel is quite thick and hard to spread. It's shiny and does not get absorbed quickly. Two or three days after I used this eye gel once at night, both my eyes look more puffy and tired-looking. An, for an unknown reason, my eyes are rheum-filled each morning when I woke up after using this. Disgusting."	"Eyes look more puffy"	"bad"
"My skin is acne prone and I have tried many things in the past to make it clear up, but nothing has worked.  At first Proactiv was a little irritating and drying for me.  Word of advice, don't get it near your eyes because the cleanser does sting.  The 3 step worked right away for me, within a couple weeks my skin started getting clear and brighter.  Occasionally I have minor breakouts, but nothing compared to before starting this kit.  It's been a year now and I've never used any of the other products in the line, except this 3 piece kit and another moisturizer.  The kit alone dries out my skin, so I use a separate moisturizer and SPF.  The price is a little high for this kit, but here on Amazon I compared to the Proactiv site and another site who also sell these products and this price here is most competitive.  I like being able to purchase what I need instead of an entire kit at one time.  A friend recommended Proactiv to me.  I would recommend this kit to most anyone except those with extremely sensitive or dry skin.  The formula is kind of strong and at first, like I said it dried my skin and stung a little if I got it near my eyes."	"Worth the price"	"good"
"I like how convenient the on the go wipes are. You can throw them anywhere, they are small enough to fit. It will take a few wipes for your whole face. I did mine with two wipes. I like that it cleaned my face. As for noticing a difference, I really didn't. I would just use these wipes as maybe just to clean your face and get rid of makeup or oil. They are nice to have around if you're not able to really wash your face with anything else."	"Very easy to use"	"neutral"
"Not only the dryer is not very effective, instead of the ordered brand new item, I received somebody else's return with the scratches on the unit and visible signs of being somewhat used. Items is being returned, I will not order it again."	"Not great"	"bad"
"My daughter asked me to get a set of these for her hair and since the last time I tried curling I got burned with the curling iron (and have some pretty nightmarish memories of getting perms as a kid) I decided to go for it and see if they worked.After some trial and error (if you are new to the whole &#34;CurlFormer&#34; thing, DEFINITELY go to YouTube and check out the videos) we figured it out- the trick is to have slightly damp hair and do the curls in small, well-combed segments. I will admit that I was hoping we could get huge segments of hair into each curler but they aren't made that way- you have to do little sections in each curler, so it does take time.But, lo and behold, when we were done she had a beautiful head of bouncy curls. She was delighted.Be warned, these aren't quick. It took well over an hour to get all her hair into the curlers once we got the process down. And they aren't comfortable, but very few curlers are (I have memories of sleeping in those bendable foam sticks in high school). But they do work very well, if you are patient and don't mind the time it takes to get the curlers in."	"takes time and patience, but the result was beautiful curls"	"good"

"I am an aging woman with dark circles around my eyes from genetics and allergies as well as just aging. I tried this cream with low hopes as I have a drawer full of unused eye cream. When this arrived I noticed a light coffee scent. That's OK with me. The scent goes away quickly when applied.  It is a large tube that last a long time. It applies well and absorbs great. I found with regular use my eyes looked much better much to my shock. I only use this AM so have not had problems with my sleep as some reviewers have reported but I sleep at night and don't have a night job etc. I try to use gluten free eye shadows and have not found any problems with make up application of the product seeping into my eyes like some products. It also stays fresh. I really love this product. Nice tube too for applicattion."	"It Works"	"good"
"Not sure about this item, used it for spot removal on my legs and it did not appear to work, will try it again and make sure I am using it correctly.

"I didn't know whether to give this product a 3 or a 4 star... this product over all is pretty good. Not waterproof! but lasts all day. I love that it has a built in eyeliner pencil. The liquid brush is really nice. The actual liquid is very shiny and not matte. I like my liquid eyeliner dark and matte very black and this product leaves it a bit shiny. which kind of bothers me a bit. still a good product!"	"shiny liquid eyeliner.."	"neutral"
"I wanted to love this product. It's such a great idea in sleek packaging, but the powder is not well pigmented and looks...chalky(?) in use? I was excited for the potential for blending, concealing and augmenting, but this really didn't do it for me. Imay give it another shot and if my results are better (maybe it was user error?), I will update this review.  As an aside, I splurged on NARS concealer and OMG, it is LOVELY!!!!"

"If you want an inexpensive black eyeliner with lots of cool impact, I reccomend instead:NYX Super Skinny Eye Marker, Carbon Black,1.1ml .  I used mine until it ran out, and loved it.I have tried every eyeliner out there.This is due to the fact that I love make up and also because I have, at times, had to appear in public \"as a public figure\" (don't ask--it isn't that interesting)  for a full day without being able to check my makeup. I need eye makeup I can count on! I don't work as a clown in these public instances and as I am pretty vain I want to look good consistently. Just telling the truth here!If you want to go for the full expense of treating yourself to a super long lasting, non creasing eye liner, because you are a famous superstar and have to look good 24/7 for the fans and those pesky paparrazzi, just mortgage your house and choose Bobbi Brown's gel eyeliner. It is absolutely fantastic. You will wear out before it does. Trust me!However, If you just want a lightweight stick liner to thow in your purse, I would have to say that this one is not my first choice. I would go for Nyx.I am NOT a spokeperson for Nyx.I am just a person with very easily creased eyelids who really dislikes that extra line I get from eyeliner that doesn't stay put.The additional thing I noticed with this liner is that is isn't all that intensely black.If you want a really BLACK black, look for another liner.Thanks,jean"	"Uh, no."	"neutral"
"I was introduced to Avon through a friend who sells it. I really wanted a superior product and there prices seems fair, checked out reviews and made purchase. I purchased Avon Glimmer stick in black and brown. I bought it from an avon store. I must say Im disapointed. I mean the stick breaks off easy (im gentle and dont even use it everyday), didnt even last 6 months. I had the SAME experience with the mascara, all of a sudden one day I went in to use it and it was broken.(how does mascara break) Not even 6 months of use."	"Avons eyeliner gimmick!"	"bad"
"I enjoy this face wash. The light, creamy texture is soothing and effective at washing away oils and leaving my face feeling fresh and moisturized.

"I'll give the product two stars simply 'cos it seems to work for other reviewers and it smells good. I really want to like Deva Curl products but they're not working out for me. I am a guy who's trying to wear his hair long but battling constant dryness and frizz. Today I used a little Mist-er Right and Set it Free and had disastrous results (even frizzier and drier than usual). I'm following the instructions and am not sure what I'm doing wrong. I can't recommend this product for my hair type (\"s-wavy\" to \"wavy\" according to Deva Curl). There's gotta be something better out there.

Well, I followed the directions and the advice of other reviewers, and it was just awful. All these little pills stuck to my skin and the fine peach fuzz on my face, and no matter what I tried to get it off, it would not come off! It took a few days to get every piece off.

"I decided to try this 'wonder mascara' after hearing great reviews but sad to say I was disappointed. They claim this mascara doesn't clump, smudge, etc, etc. Lies. The first time I tried this mascara it went on great at first but as I applied it started bunching some of my lashes together so instead of long beautiful lashes I had some clumps that got stuck together that I could not free without washing off the mascara. That being said I think the brush is crap and this mascara was not worth it. If you're going to spend over $20 you might as well go for gold and buy Lancome for a little more and actually get beautiful lashes."	"Did not live up to the hype."	"bad"
"I have very sensitive skin which breaks out in rashes from washing them so much (I work in childcare and MUST wash at least 10 times a day changing diapers).I use this in the shower everyday, and it has been the only soap that helps soothe skin.

"This conditioner does the job. It coats the hair well, smells pleasant, and seems to work fine. After using it rinses out well and my hair feels soft and manageable. I really can't find any superlative things to say about it, it does the job without any problems. I will say that I have an issue with telling which is the shampoo and which is the conditioner because the bottles are almost identical and I always forget which is which.I can't really tell if there is a benefit to using this on my colored hair or not. Everything seems fine with this conditioner, nothing stands out as being wonderful or awful. I did not have any leakage like other reviewers have reported with the shipping of this product. The cost is reasonable, that might be the best thing about this product.  I do like that the product is thick and not a runny consistency, it's easier to apply when I can get it to my head without having it drip off my hand."	"Pleasant, average conditioner"	"neutral"

"The Clear brand dandruff shampoos seem to be everywhere now. They use pyrithione zinc to control dandruff, similar to other brands, but cost a bit more in my experience. If they work the same for dandruff control, then they can only differentiate themselves in fragrance, texture, and cleaning.FRAGRANCETypical dandruff shampoos smell medicinal, but not bad. More expensive shampoos often have really strong invigorating smells like mint. This shampoo (Complete Care), with a price between the two extremes, has a floral fragrance that reminds me of cheap children's perfume.  It is not terrible, but I think a simple \"clean\" smell would be much better.TEXTUREAnother review nailed the texture as \"melted ice cream.\" More importantly, it lathers well and is easy to spread through even long hair.CLEANINGThis shampoo left my hair feeling clean, but not stripped.

I twisted the semi curly hairs. I clipped at my part.  I tried it air dry and with a difuser. None gave me good curls.  I have much better luck with DEVACURL gel.  I think this may work better for super curly hair.  I could see it keeping nice ringlets if that were the case.

"The concept is a great idea, but like Zsu Zsu Pets, it's a fad, and poorly designed. After being put together, it does come apart easily, and really all you're doing is putting your feet into a bunch of colorful beads. It's fun for smaller children, but not made for kids older than 10, or those with bigger feet than a 10 year old. This feels good to the foot, but does not work like a real soothing spa would, with jets, and all the bells and whistles. This is just a toy, so if you are expecting it to release stress from your child, it won't. It's made for the fun feel of the beads and that's it. Save your money on this one, it's like any other toy with beads, you need constant refills, and heaven forbit those little buggars spill on your floor, good luck picking them up!

But after my daughter pulled off the pad to wash it the first time, the pad kept sliding off whenever she brushed her hair.  She has medium thick hair past her shoulder blades.  She doesn't mind pushing the pad back into the handle, but it would drive me crazy.  Whenever I see that the pad is not pushed in all the way, I can't help but do it for her and it is not easy.

"These are basic, cheap-quality makeup pouches.  The smaller one is pretty much a standard size to fit in most purses, while the larger one is probably more useful for travel.Both have wipe-clean vinyl interiors, which is always a plus for makeup bags.  However, the material is very thin and flimsy.  The pattern on the smaller one (sailboats and ropes) leaves a lot to be desired.Overall, I'd give them an average rating.  I doubt anyone is going to open the box and think, \"Wow!\"If you're looking for a well-made (and funky) cosmetic case, I highly recommend the ones by Betsey Johnson.

"No. Just no. I realize these are cheap brushes and that's ok. I expected to use these for about a month to three months before they fell apart. You never know though, some cheaply priced brushes last a good long time. Not these! I got them in the mail an hour ago. The first thing i noticed when opening them was the smell. The nasty disgusting smell. It smells like cat pee.Im not exaggerating.  I fully believe a cat peed on this set. The bristles feel like pine needles on your skin. Which you wash because of the cat pee smell. I washed them thinking that would loosen up the bristles and kill the smell. It loosened up the bristles all right. Loosened them up so that 50% of the whole set went down my drain. Fantastic. The smell can't be removed by any brush cleaner, shampoo,  brush soak or Hogwarts magic. The smell is now on my hands. On the plus side the case is nice. Can't apply makeup with a case though. I'll be looking for another set. Enjoy my money for the order of cat pee I didn't ask for."	"Disgusting!"	"bad"
"This is a fantastic, smooth, truly translucent matte finishing powder that doesn't turn my olive skin to an ashy looking hue. The packaging is so brilliant, that once you screw off the lid, there's a plastic knob you turn, and then you can shake out the powder that you need without it going everywhere in a huge dust cloud whenever you take off the lid. This second safety lid sealing in the powder, and its cute size, meant I immediately ordered a second one for my purse with no worries of it spilling. I rarely wear compact powders because they frequently have oils and other binders which break my skin out. Usually, I just carry blotting papers, but depending on where I am, I now have a choice about how I'll deal with any mid day shine. This product gives me, no breakouts, no mess, a reasonable price, fast shipping, professional service, and the most gorgeous finish to my Nars foundation ever. It's a true win/win!"	"No ashiness!"

"There are at least 80 other reviews for this product already, most of which talks about its effectiveness, scent, lather, etc., so I don't feel I need to go into that. Suffice it to say, this is a good body wash.The one \"con\" for me with this product is the packaging. Looks good, but once the soap gets down to a certain level, it become a bit difficult to use. That's because the packaging makes it so that it naturally wants to be squeezed from the middle. Ok, but once you use about half the product, it gets harder to get the product out by squeezing from the middle, and squeezing from the bottom just seems awkward, and doesn't work as well. Your hand (which is usually wet) just slips back up to the middle.So, for me, this would be a better product with a slightly different bottle design."	"Good Body Wash, So-So Packaging"	"neutral"
"It's not water proof and that is not the worst, but immediately after applying it on our faces, my daughter and I felt like we had a sunburn. Felt sort of hot and tingly till we scrubbed it off some hours later when we got home.Kept us from burning, but felt uncomfortably hot on the skin. I never had such a sensation from a sun screen.We always purchased natural sunscreen products from Weleda and Dr. Hauschka line, when we lived in Europe. These are the best, but could not get them on Amazon or in the USA.Makes me very suspicious to feel something heating up my face - and not stopping to do so for hours on end. I worried what was in there and got rid of the thing.I also must remark that the tube looks nice and large, and deceptive at that, as contents is in USA seems to go weight NOT VOLUME, hehe. So there's very little in there for the price they charge.I still have a tube from Dr. Hauschka from pre-2009 and it was the most amazing product ever. Same size as the American Eco Logical, only FULL of goodness and value for money.BTW, [...] I see  a thread mentioning the EU forced them to kill their amazing sunscreen products [likely as part of their fight against natural producers in order to help the big drug companies reduce competition]."

I had to order another one today so that i can use it for my nail polish remover.Update - my first bottle didn't have the wording on it which I really like because I use it for makeup remover and it sits on my sink.  I bought another one to use for my nail polish remover and this one has the word alcohol on it.  I guess I don't mind it because nail polish remover is kind of like alcohol....  i like the bottle without the wording though.

"Overall, as a regular shampoo, this shampoo has less lather than my other shampoo (Pantene) but otherwise seems to clean my hair well enough without overly tripping oils from it.  The scent is a medium fruity-floral.  After using it one week on, one week off and comparing it to Pantene, this shampoo does seem to leave my hair soft and manageable.However, this shampoo also advertises itself as a low-sulfate shampoo.  This means:Pros:+ Does not dry hair and scalp as much as higher sulfate shampoos.+ Gentle on scalp. Scalp does not itch after washing+ Does not fade coloured hair as much as shampoos with higher sulfate content.+ Does not corrode nor damage hair folicles+ This shampoo is low-sulfate not no-sulfate so it still does lather although not as much as high sulfate brands such as Pantene.+ While sulfate damage is still there, it is not as damaging as high sulfate brands.Cons:- This shampoo does contain sulfates (even at lower amounts).- This shampoo, as a result of low sulfate content, does not lather as much in hard water conditions- A second shampoo may be needed to fully wash hair because of low lather. For regular daily use, a single shampoo is enough, but on hot humid sweaty days or after a session a the gym, I needed to shampoo my hair twice.  While this may be because I have to get used to the lower-lather of low-sulfate shampoos, it is still something to consider depending on your lifestyle as it impacts how much of this product you would use and how much it will cost over time.Overall, I like this shampoo enough to consider switching to it for regular daily shampoo and keep my high sulfate Pantene for a day at the gym."

"First off, I had high hopes with this foundation. VERY high. After I applied the foundation I went to school, the lighting in my bathroom has always been a little odd so I didn't really notice how bad my foundation was. At school, people pulled me aside to tell me how cakey and ORANGE my skin was. Quickly, I ran to the bathroom and noticed that my foundation was EXTREME orange and dry (even though I was using a high end primer and had no problems with any other foundation) When I got home, I looked over the bottle to make sure I hadn't grabbed one of the darker shades instead, but no it was still porcelain ivory. I applied it to my hand and went into direct sunlight and I looked like a huge pumpkin.Shades need fixed!Also, I am not DEATH pale I am more of a olive pale shade, and porcelain ivory was still to orange and dark for me.Cons:-Orange based-Makes dry skin look even more dry.-Doesn't even last two hours (I had to keep reapplying it)I think this foundation would be good for someone with a darker oily complexion. For people with light skin and dry skin, I don't recommend."	"NOT FOR LIGHT AND DRY SKIN"	"bad"

"Having declared an all-out war against my pores a few months ago, I've attacked them with countless highly-rated anti-pore product on the market.Besides  being dry-ish and sensitive-ish, my skin is largely unproblematic.I've only tried Biore Pore Perfect Deep Cleansing Pore Strips once, a few days ago. I followed the instructions perfectly, and after painfully ripping the dried out, Papier-mch&eacute;d strip from my nose, I was slightly disappointed. The strip had successfully pulled out some pore-clogging gunk, but not as much as I had hoped. Despite the removed gunk, the pores on my nose looked the same an hour later (if that). After a day, I think my pores had actually gotten larger. In fact, for the next few days, my pores looked the worse they had in some time.I've yet to find a miracle product that would drastically improve the appearance of my pores. Using witch hazel as a toner regularly and wearing zinc-oxide based sunscreens (sun damage, esp. by UV A rays, causes 85% of skin damage and enlarges pores as a result. High SPFs only control for UV B rays, and zinc oxide is the most effective and most stable of UV A blocks) religiously has helped.

"I started using the Braun Oral-B electric brushes in the early 90's and switched to the Philips Sonicare line about 10 years ago. I love electric toothbrushes, and I prefer the \"sonic\" approach that Sonicare always used to the mechanical one that Oral-B used to use.When as a Vine reviewer I got a chance to try out the Panasonic I wanted to do so, though I couldn't find replacement brushes and that's a big part of the cost (and usefulness). I like the fact that you can find good prices on either Oral-B or Sonicare in the places you'd expect to.But this is junk and I'm shocked that Panasonic would put out something this bad at this price. As I write this, amazon is charging about $125 for this and for that you can get a very nice Oral-B or Sonicare. So what is so bad about this?1) The unit/handle itself is very very lightweight, uses cheap-feeling plastic, so the grip isn't great, and the battery isn't very long-lasting either. I know that most people put the brush back in the holder after each use but I like the fact that I can get almost 2 weeks from my sonicare without the charger - at least a solid week without worrying. There's no way that this will do that.2) I once got some generic brushes for my Sonicare and they were junk, and these feel exactly the same way.3) While I haven't found replacement brushes for this yet, it seems a safe bet that this brush won't take off and thus the brushes will be hard to find and expensive.The one thing I can't criticize it the base: It's just like the minimal bases that the other brands use and I see no reason why it won't hold up.If Panasonic were charging $60 bucks for this I still wouldn't recommend it, but at least I would understand someone considering it. For anything over that, this is junk. I think the only people who might buy this and not return it are those who have never used an electric brush before and buy don't have a point of comparison."

"I typically useClean & Clear Morning Burst Skin Brightening Cleanserto wash my face, because I like how clean and smooth my skin feels afterwards.  It lathers up nicely and actually *feels* clean to me afterwards.  I feel refreshed.With Nivea Sensitive Face Wash for Men, the liquid feels more slippery going on, it doesn't lather much, and I don't get that same refreshing feel following the wash.  Yes, my face may be clean, but I like that feeling of confirmation.  I also like the scent of Clean & Clear Morning Burst, and this Nivea product doesn't really have one.  It also \"wakes me up,\" whereas this Nivea product doesn't.I'm not sure what makes it for \"men,\" other than the packaging and the fact that it's also pretty much unscented (I guess for \"men\" who don't want to smell like any kind of fragrance).Would I buy this again?  No. Clean & Clear Morning Burst offers what I want in a facial cleanser.  But it's probably good for guys who may be allergic to other facial cleansers and want something unscented."	"OK if you're a guy who wants an unscented facial cleanser"	"neutral"
"I've been a fan ofUltimate UV Defense SPF 30 - Skin Ceuticals - Day Care - 90ml/3ozfor years and decided to try this one instead, I don't like it as much. Because it's a liquid, it's difficult to apply evenly to your skin and tell where it's going. Also, throughout the course of the day, I noticed my skin was not any less oily than it normally is with the other Skinceuticals Ultimate sunscreen.So, for me, this sunscreen provides no benefit over my prior Skinceuticals sunscreen. When it runs out, I'm switching back."	"Difficult to see where you are applying it"	"bad"
"I really like the scent of this...its a yummy almost dessert-like scent...not overpowering but just a light scent that is much better than any other night creams I normally use. (I'm not fond of the perfumey types and this one is not that) This moisturizer has a cream, luxurious feel that I am now hooked on! And, its not so oily/greasy like some creams - in the morning when I wake up my face is still smooth and feels moisturized without any greasy feel. Definitely a keeper for me!"	"Love the scent!"	"good"
"They're really pretty colors, alot fell out; but I was pretty satisfied overall though.I honestly wouldn't mind buying again."	"They were pretty decent."	"neutral"
"So like a lot of people, I am not financially able to go out and buy really expensive brushes. Everyone, and literally everyone talks about how great these brushes are and how they are very comparable to other more expensive brands (MAC).However, just because they are comparable does not mean anything. I have had a lot of brushes from Sigma, not just the Duo set, each and everyone except the blush brush and foundation paddle brush have shedded. Not just once or twice, but for months. These brushes shed even more than my Essence of Beauty brushes from CVS that I had before I got these. Also, none of the brushes are actually very dense, which can be a problem. Lastly, these brushes are massive in comparison to the face. I personally like working with smaller brushes because it gives me more control in application and of product dispersal. I could never get the look I wanted with the Sigma brushes.I know that these brushes are highly rated because of their price point. However, there can be great quality in cheaper brands as well. I am a college student = ( poor), and it does not matter what the price is; if the quality is bad, the product is nothing to me.For the past 6 months, I switched to the bdellium tools brushes. I did not buy the kit, just the 949, small foundation 947, and 957. These brushes are cheaper, softer, and more densely packed. I also purchased Real Techniques brushes, they are VERY great quality brushes that are different from most other brands. They are also made of Teflon, so the brushes absorb less in the strands and deposit more than just normal synthetic brushes.However if you are really on a tough budget, I do not recommend any of the Sigma brushes at all. I recommend the ELF powder brush, Eco-tools brushes, Bdellium Tools, Real Techniques, and honestly hands. Just because times are tough does not mean quality should go down, in fact, I usually think the BEST quality products should be purchased that are possible as a kind of gift to oneself."	"Not Good Quality"	"bad"
"I initially skipped Bikini So Teeny because I'm not into glittery, shimmery polish - just not my style. I finally saw the bottle in person (in a store) and barely noticed the sparkle until I held it up to the fluorescent light. I decided to buy it anyway, and I'm so glad I did!I received SO many compliments because it's a unique color without being too over-the-top. It's richer than a pastel and bright enough to be fun, but muted enough to avoid a juvenile cutesy look. The shimmer is VERY subtle and to be honest, I barely noticed it. It's also a really fun pedi color.Pro tip - if you want the color to appear brighter or more neon, wear a layer of opaque white (I use OPI Alpine Snow) underneath :)"	"great pedi color and works in winter, spring, or summer!"	"good"

"I thought this would add some red tone to my dark brown hair with natural highlights. I saw that others reviewed it magenta on blond hair but mine is brown so I thought no problem. Despite combing it through very carefully and letting it set 20 min I got a streaky magenta tinge all over with severely magenta tips. And it would be a huge mess (think Psycho) if you were trying to use it in the shower everyday."	"Really magenta and a mess"	"bad"
"Pure Body Naturals has a great Vitamin c Serum. It highlights skin in a beautiful tone. I found the dropper very easy to use and the concentration is high enough to not need much so your product will last longer.I love the money back guarantee. I was fully satisfied with my serum, but it always feels good to know that a company stands behind what they make. I definitely recommend giving this a try!"	"awesome serum"	"good"
"The product itself was okay, I didn't peel as much as I wanted. I even did the darn peel every week but I just wasn't impressed with the product.As for the service there was a mix up with the order, they sent me the wrong order but they did fixed it and let me keep the product they sent me along with what I ordered."	"Love it"	"neutral"
"Why foam? It's kind of messy and smells a little sour. It definitely tingles on application for me which is uncomfortable. A little goes a long way. It seemed to sit on top of my skin without really sinking in. The package is  wasteful on this and all the Definity products in terms of the huge hunk of plastic involved. It's an okay moisturiser but it does not hold a candle to the correcting protective lotion in the same line. That one goes on nicer, is in a more familiar form of a lotion pump, does not sting and has sun protection. Gives all the same glucosamine benefits too.Skip this one and get the Definity correcting protective lotion."	"Weird texture and mild sting for me. Prefer the Correcting fluid."	"bad"
"I liked the Suave Naturals Rainforest Fresh Shampoo.  After using it for several weeks, I've found that it does a good job of cleaning my (greasy) hair without any buildup.  The \"Rainforest Fresh\" scent is pleasant without being too perfumy (which I really appreciated).Otherwise, the shampoo was unremakable to a half dozen other Suave products that I've used in the past or the three or four other shampoo brands that I and my wife typically rotate through."	"Does A Decent Job"	"good"
"I will begin by saying I have used Oil of Olay products since I was seventeen.  So, when I get the chance to try a new Oil of Olay product, I jump on it.  This new product Olay Intensive Firming product has several pros and cons.  For the pros:I liked the packaging, very pretty.I like a serum in comparison to a cream.  The serum was very silky feeling.I wear contacts so I am very leery of placing anything gooey next to my eyes as it has a tendency to travel into my eye.  I must say, however, that this product did not do that.I liked the idea of a mask soaked in serum for maximum effect.I find Oil of Olay is as good a product as anything else out there and usually for a lot less.It did make my skin softer while I was using the product.For the cons:Even being an Oil if Olay product, the price of this particular product wasoutrageous and if I had not been offered this product through the Vine Program, I would not have spent the money for it.The mask was extremely cold to put on and felt uncomfortable. It took several minutes to get the mask in place and keep it in place.The chin portion of the mask kept falling of my neck and I had to reapply the chin portion several times.I did not want to apply the mask after the first couple of nights. It was too time consuming for my taste.It makes it hard to do anything but sit and watch TV as it was difficult to fit glasses over it to read.Overall, I preferred the serum alone and not the masks.  I would purchase just the serum but would not purchase the masks.  But the price will have to come way down before I spend the amount of money they are wanting for a product that really didn't produce a miracle.  And at my age, 52, I need a miracle."	"I have always liked Oil of Olay products."	"neutral"
"I didn't notice any difference in my skin nor was I able to finish the bottle, even after using it daily, I had to end up throwing it away due to the aging of it (turned yellow)."	"No difference"	"bad"
"This is a nice, sleek and durable blow dryer. Very easy to handle and operate. Cool color. I would definitely Recommend it."	"Goody is good.."	"good"
"Great mild scent, pretty moisturizing but it's a little challenge to work through hair so I use the rinse out conditioner first, lightly rinse and that seems to help move the other through. I then put a shower cap on my daughter's head and finish her bath/shower. I only partially rinse it out so that she keeps some of the moisture."	"Good moisturizer but a little hard to work through the hair"	"neutral"
"I've used the water proof mascara in the pink and green tube 4 ever. this doesn't cover well nor does it stay on.  you can barely see I have anything on.  the only plus is no raccoon eyes and it's gone by bedtime."	"doesn't stay on for me"	"bad"

"I apply LipFusion  just before bed.  I live in Michigan and we had the coldest weather in Northern Michigan, since I have lived here.  No dryness, flakiness, and my lips feel good and they are a bit more plump.  At 69 I noticed my lips &#34;thining&#34;.  LipFusion has given me more upper lip, and made my lips look very healthy.  I am sold."	"amazing for me"	"good"

"I have shoulder length hair. After I tried it for 3 days, my hair is so dry now, and it made my hair look more flat. I think I will only use it once a week instead of using it everyday. Another thing is one of the bottle was broken after I received my package (see the picture I uploaded), I have contacted the seller, but they ignored me."	"It made my hair dry"	"bad"
"I have really enjoyed this product so far. The lip butter is smooth and leaves your lips feeling soft and supple. The case is attractive and small enough to fit into a compartment in a handbag. The colour lasts for a good while. Overall I really like this product and would recommend it to other ladies."	"Very nice"	"good"

"First, I took a few stars off for the frustrating factors of having to wait a month to receive it! I'm definitely an instant gratification type.  Once I did get it, it's a good brush. No shedding, and seems to blend makeup well."	"Good brush,  but"	"neutral"
"Let's preface this review by saying that the majority of the hair and body care products I use is Suave. I have often tried other more expensive products, but return to Suave, as the quality, performance, and price can't be beat.That being said, I am quite sure this shampoo would be wonderful...but, I couldn't stand the smell. I know smell is subjective, but I think the turn off was because the product was damaged in shipping:1 STAR for product shipment! This is the 2nd beauty product I've received that has been shipped by Amazon in just a padded envelope...and damaged. Gross. There is nothing worse than trying to remove a bottle of thick liquid that has leaked over everything. You could smell the shampoo as soon as my husband walked in the door with the package. And it was so strong, it turned my stomach. Perhaps in its small, recommended dose of application it is fine (as the same ginger and honeysuckle leave-in product didn't bother me quite as much). But, that overwhelming scent (which reminded me of a fussy old lady with too much flowery perfume) smeared all over and inside the ripped up, torn up bag turned me off...and I had a hard time even using it.4 STARS: So...based on my prior experience and love of Suave products, I would likely have rated the shampoo a 4, if the overwhelming scent bomb caused by insufficient packaging hadn't changed my mind.Amazon shipping is usually great &#8211; but, again, the two damaged shipments I've received have both been beauty products, which should obviously be protected against loss of liquid everywhere. As a result, my overall review comes out somewhere in the middle... :-("	"Thumbs down on scent and shipping; Thumbs up on Suave!"	"bad"
"I absolutely love this stuff.  I had been eye-ing a few different water sprays, but I never understood why anyone would spend money on what seemed like just water in a can.  Now I get it!  I am very fair skinned and extremely sensitive to temperature changes, so when the air gets dry in the winter but the heat is blasting, my skin isn't happy.  When I'm overheated, my face is very red and blotchy.  My skin is also extremely sensitive to chemicals, so I have to be careful about what products I use on it.  I keep this spray can in my fridge and after a workout or a hot shower, I spray this mist on and it feels amazing. You can see it dew up on your skin for a few moments and it calms down my skin by about 50% immediately.  It also is great for spritzing right before you moisturize -- it locks in moisture really well.  I will never be without this product. Highly recommend for anyone who gets red in the face and needs a natural, refreshing way to cool down!"	"Much Better Than Expected!!"	"good"

It arrived within 7 days of the order.Everyone on internet were raving so much about the product that I was just waiting to try it after fully charging it. I tried it for 1 min and my cheeks started burning so much. I use really mild cleanser which never burnt my skin so much. I have stopped using the product. To me its a expensive wash cloth!!!"

"i've always been a huge fan of the dream matte mousse foundation and i've been using ever last drop of it. it's another foundation that's perfect for oily skin and controlling oil, plus it also gives that matte finish without giving you that \"cakey\" apperance."

"It works, definitely, but within 24 hours of application, it starts chipping and coming right off. And I don't mean little chips, big chips.

"This is an excellent product!  I use it on dry hair on my non-shampoo days.  Works great to repair flat and unruly &#34;bed head.&#34;  Gives definition and helps control frizz. I spray a few pumps on my fingers then slide my fingers near my scalp to &#34;lift&#34; my short curls at the roots.  Then I spray a bit more on my hands and scrunch it in."	"Use this everyday!"

"I have a hard time recommending this product to others because for me it works inconsistently.  There are days when this masque works like a dream and then there are days where after I rinse this out, it looks like my hair hasn't seen conditioner in a year. Even when I use heat, I get erratic results from this product.  I do like the fact that it smells nice, and a little goes a long way.  But that could be my hair is short.  Detangling properties is minimal but I always detangle my hair before I shampoo and try my darnest not to over manipulate my hair when shampooing.  Once I finish this product, I will not repurchase."	"This is a parsnickety product for me"	"bad"
"I must say that I just love love love my brushed from Teal Techniques. I have had Mac brushes for more than 6 years and always found them shedding, these have not shed a single hair and they are so so soft and my skin goes all uhmmm and aaahhh when I use them!For the Blush brunch: it is just beautiful and perfect!!! it takes up the blush well and blends it well. I also use it for other powder for setting my makeup all over. For this purpose it is also great!"	"Love love love"	"good"
"I bought these because I loved that they were different colors and colorful, when I received mine they are all one color and there isn't any directions on how to use them or tips for making designs. Thank goodness there is youtube videos. If they came the colors shown and with some kind of how-to directions i would give it a 5 stars."	"Tips for using please?"	"neutral"
"It's a great liner with tip that allows for a thin or thick line.  It has great staying power.  However, there's virtually NO product in the container.  I've purchased it three times and each tube has lasted less than a month.  This is ridiculous considering I use very little of it as I draw thin lines and use it once daily at most.One other BIG drawback with Covergirl products is they still use animal testing!!!  Are you reading this CoverGirl?"	"Would love it but...."	"bad"

"Don't get me wrong...This is a fabulous product. Good shampoo, shower gel and it smells awesome. But because it's an add-on, I noticed that when we rate them &#34;too good&#34; they come back at twice the price on Prime. So should I review my pruchased add-ons honestly if Amazon act like that?As it is, I just paid $79 for my Prime membership and everything that I need on Prime became more expensive than last year. Now, if I want a certain product and it's an add-on...well, I need to order for $25 from Amazon. Then if I review this add-on and give it an excellent review, I will pay twice the price when  it will be available only on Prime.Isn't it the way it works now on Amazon? This is probably the last year that I pay for Prime membership. An advice to the maker of that soap (I also have the lavender lotion) : Sell on your own website and I'll buy it. I know $9.99 is too good to be true for 32 oz of your quality product, but I won't get hooked and pay twice the price when it will be available on Prime only. It's very dishonest from the part of Amazon, it is a bad marketing to threat customers like morons."	"I love it but I won't tell.......Add-ons!"	"neutral"
"I LOVE Paris's first perfume (no clue what it's called, maybe just \"Paris Hilton\"..) so I was hoping to like this one too..I was wrong. To make a long review short and save you some time, I'll just say this: It smells like old lady. Save your money and buy ANY of Britney Spears' perfumes or Jessica Simpson's line or if you are the kind of person who loves buying blood diamonds and poached ivory products, buy some of Justin Bieber's perfumes. His perfumes smell great and have staying power, but every time I spray them on a little part of me dies..."	"Yuck"	"bad"

"A few days later you may have to start worrying about dryness of your hair. I notice this a lot with at home highlights and dyes. Before you buy this, buy a deep conditioner or you can use it with the one that is provided with the product. But overall, I love my highlights and the base color this product gave me!

"I needed a shampoo and conditioner that was more moisturizing, so I decided to try this since I've alway liked Herbal Essences, since way back in the day when it first came out. This one, however, doesn't get a thumbs up. I guess it is moisturizing, but it also weighs my hair down. In addition, I feel like I need to shampoo my hair every day because it feels sort of oily by the second day. I wish they still made the original formula that came out in 1972."	"Thumbs Down"	"bad"
"This product really did the trick on my wavy, frizzy, bleached hair.  They have a tutorial on L'Oreal's website saying to put this from about the middle of your hair down.  I put it from about my ears down because my hair is down to my waist, then whatever is left on my hands I quickly gloss over the top of my head trying not to get it near my part.  No greasiness and no frizz.  Some people have mentioned a strong odor, I personally didn't find it to be that strong, but if you are sensitive to perfumes in your hair products you might want to see if you can try this from a friend before you buy it."	"Love it"	"good"

I hate shiny face look, and who wants to take ALL their mascara off every night? Rubbing the skin around your eyes so much is not good for retaining elasticity.They didn't list the ingredients, so I took  chance. Here they are so you don't have to:Ricinus Communis (fancy name for caster oil), Lanolin, Triticum Vulgae (fancy name for wheat germ oil) - First 3 ingredients are oil ... as I continueCetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Palminate, Silica, Tocopheryl Acetate (name for vitamin e), Limonene, Linalool, ParfumUnless you can find a better use for this, I'm better off using it on my lips."

"The hairdryier works great, leaving your hair soft, silky and manageable. the instrucions to place the conditioner cartridge are easy.The bad side.....it's a little heavy.The operation buttons are treaky because they are located where you place your hand to handle it, due to this sometimes the fingers touch thebuttons and the temperature or the speed gets changed, so this is a little unconfortable.Overall its a good product, good results.I will recommend it."

"This shampoo by Clear says it is a nourishing frizz control formula. My hair is long and tends toward being dry and frizzy, so I was excited to try this new shampoo. It's creamy and lightly scented with a delightful fragrance. It doesn't make a lot of lather (a good thing in my estimation). It comes in great bottle that sits neatly on the dispenser end and is easy to open with wet hands in the shower.I used the matching conditioner by Clear during the week I used this. The problem is that it just didn't work for my hair as well as other shampoos I've been using. My hair was still frizzy and dry after using this and it made my scalp feel a little greasy the next day after shampooing. I used it for a full week and the results were the same.One of the other people in my house, who has normal, non-frizzy hair, likes it a lot and is continuing to use it so it's not a bad shampoo. However, because it says it's for frizz control, I must give it 3 stars with regard to how it worked on my hair."	"Didn't control my frizz"	"neutral"

"I was really hoping that this would work for me but it really was not the best. It was more like a clear coat for me, as it just made my nails a little more transluscent and not so much white. I did notice a \"pinking\" of the nail bed, but it wasn't a very definite change. I will give it another try and see how it works, but to me, it doesn't justify the price tag. Given the chance, I most likely would not repurchase."	"Hate to be the one to bring it down, but..."	"neutral"
"I really like facial wipes as I am sometimes too lazy to get up and wash my face. I like that this one has vitamin c as I like what it does for my skin. Unfortunately I found this to be very drying.

"TheRemington D3020 Volume and Shine Hair Dryeris fine, but there is no noticeable benefit from its \"ionic ceramic technology\" that provides \"90% more ions for extreme volume & shine.\"Like many hair dryers, this one has 1875 watts  with 3 heat settings, 2 speed settings and a cool shot button.  Two attachments are included: a diffuser for waves and curls as well s a concentrator for straight hair. The air filter is removable.I prefer theInfiniti by Conair 223XR, 1875 Watt Tourmaline Ceramic 2-in-1 Styler, Cord Reel Dryerwhich also has 1875 watts with 3 heat settings, 2 speed settings and a cool shot button. Although it has the same wattage, it seems more powerful. I also like that it has a button to retract the cord into the handle - no need to wrap the cord around it or use a rubber band.  I've had mine since July 2009 and it works as well as it did when I first purchased it.The Remington D3020 hair dryer will be available to my overnight guests.

"I've been using this for 2 months. I don't notice much when I use this product.  It accentuates the darkness under my eyes, so I stopped using it there.  I also believe it was making me break out on my cheeks, so I stopped using it there too. It's moisturizing, so it's good for dry patches. I am in my early 30's and don't have wrinkles, so maybe it would work better for someone with different skin texture? I think the only benefit is the moisturizing properties, which I don't really need."	"It's OK"	"neutral"
"i am someone who is really into skin and beauty care products so i have tried A LOT of them, mainly the high end ones. i was asking my (very good) dermatologist what she recommends i use to treat any expression lines (i am in my thirties and i dont really have wrinkles). She said: 1 word, RETINOL. she recommended Roc Retinol Correxion Eye cream or Neutrogena's. so when i started using Roc at night, i noticed it was very drying for the eye contour, so she recommended i use a moisturizer over it. after a thorough research for THE best moisturizing eye cream, i found La Roche-Posay's Hydraphase to be the best for the job. i purchased it and it worked ABSOLUTELY GREAT. no more drying whatsoever in exactly 48hours. texture was wonderful, light and fast drying. then, after i finished this one, i thought i'd try something else for a change, and i went to Kiehl's. well, alas, it didn't moisturize as well. i still get some drying especially on the top lid, even though i use it in the morning over my Estee Lauder Renutriv Ultimate Eye Lift AND at night over Roc..in addition to this, i absolutely hated the texture. it is very thick and exactly like glue. it does not go smoothly over the skin. it is annoying and i cant wait to finish it so i can go back to Hydraphase. you should avoid putting it close to your eyelids because your vision will be blurred afterwards if you need to read something. Plus i dont like to have to put my fingers inside a jar, especially an eye cream jar, because the cream gets into your finger nails."	"Very average"	"bad"
"This spiking glue really holds up, but it's not rock hard. It's unlike any other strong-hold product I've used -  Straight out of the tube it's tacky, like a paste, but once worked into my hair it's not sticky or hard. It holds strong all day without that shellac look. Oh, and it smells great. A nice fresh scent, not too strong. I even use this on my young son's hair and it holds up to the rough play of a 5-yr-old. If you need to revive it you can work damp hands through your hair and it will continue to hold when dry. Washes out easily in the shower. I highly recommend this spiking glue!"	"Strong Hold, No Shellac"	"good"
"I had to apply this product at least 4 times a day and I always would smell bad when it would wear off. I switched to a product called Natural for Her by Herban Cowboy from my local natural market. It has no parabens, triclosan, alcohol, propylene glycol and especially no aluminum at all. And this stuff lasts all day and I don't smell. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!"

"I have used drugstore conditioners that can do better than this stuff. All it is is a very all natural conditioner that smells horrible and leaves you smelling like it even after its rinsed out. You can use regular conditioners to do the same thing. Its just the method of using conditioner washing. Use Giovanni if you want all natural and not stinky and it gives better results (and speaking on behalf of naturally curlies with african american hair)I even use Pantene for curly hair and it works just fine."	"If you can get pass the smell..its still not worth it"	"bad"
"My new find and obsession. It cleanses my oily (!) skin without drying it out. It is very important since most people with oily skin try to use something that will give them that squeaky clean feeling, except it only triggers skin to produce EVEN more oil! This product does the opposite: it moisturizes and cleans without irritating the skin. It's all natural and it smell wonderful, like fresh oranges! Absolutely definitely a must!"

"With the latest studies indicating the extraordinary benefits of wearing sunscreen, I think we need to acknowledge that it is always worth your time to wear it. Now, I usually useSimple Protecting Light Moisturizer Spf 15orDr. T's Supergoop!. Nonetheless, I was more than happy to give this less expensive product a try. (I am all for spending less money on comparable products). I was impressed with a number of features, and not so impressed with others ... here's my report:Pros:1.) Orange bottle! This means it is easy to spot in the sand. Nice touch!2.) Leaves no while streaks!! (I love this aspect so much!! And, I really, really, REALLY pile this stuff on!)3.) At first it was a little tacky, then I waited a few minutes and that tackiness had entirely disappeared. (This is also a HUGE bonus! The dust, dirt, and sand did not stick to my arms and legs ... a welcome change!)Con:The one giant con is the smell. It is a large, chemical, lasting odor. It is not the typical smell of sunscreen or even the nostalgic smell of coconuts. This is an extremely big, unappealing smell. If you can get passed this one \"flaw\" then this sunscreen is amazing!For this price and this level protection, it is worth your trying this Banana Boat product. If the smell is too much to tolerate, pass it on to a friend who may not mind it as much. Try it, you might like it!"	"Let's Face It, All Sunscreen is Good Sunscreen..."	"neutral"

"I purchased this scent along with a bottle of Lolita Lempicka.  It is a lighter scent than the original Lempicka, has a more salty vanilla smell to it along with underlying notes which I can't describe.  Its not musky or overpowering.  If you like a lighter scent which smells sweet but not too sweet or cloying this is for you.  I can smell the vanilla more than anything else.  I'm not a big vanilla person but with the other scents in this it is very beautiful and sensual.  Definitely a day perfume though.  I highly recommend it.  Sorry if my description is not very good."

"I bought 2 of these gloves with the specific intent of using them in conjunction with Keratin treatments, which require a 450 degree flat iron.  I used the gloves a number of times with the iron set at 392 and 419.  They worked fairly well.  You can feel the heat for sure, but no burning as long as you keep moving.Unfortunately, they do not perform well with higher temps.  I did my Keratin treatment today and set the iron at 455. They did not protect my fingers nearly as well. However, I would not have been able to do the job at all without the gloves.I would have given 4 stars but the seam opened in the web of one glove and I ended up with a burned thumb ... from my hair, not the flat iron."

"Horrible! It does not dry for a long time, and it smells horrible! Just breathing through my nose made me feel like my nose was on fire! And the smell stayed even after it dried.

It cleans and leaves no residue, a little bit goes a long way, but I have color treated heir and it felt stripped after I washed with this shampoo.

"I am disappointed that the seller has not listed the product ingredients.  This is a requirement for product labeling but does not appear to be a requirement of Amazon.com for product listings.I went to Physicians Formula's website and found a product listing for what I think is the same product.  It was listed under the name of \"Eye Booster 2-in-1 Lash Boosting Eyeliner + Serum\" in  black.Product list:Water. Ethylhexyl Acrylate/Methyl Methacrylate Copolymer. Butylene Glycol. SD Alcohol 40. Beheneth-30. Ammonium Acrylates/Methyl Styrene/Styrene Copolymer. Glycerin. Myristoyl Pentapeptide-17. 1,2-Hexanediol. Acrylates/Octylacrylamide Copolymer. Caprylyl Glycol. Ethylhexylglycerin. Pentylene Glycol. Polyglyceryl-3 Disiloxane Dimethicone. Phenoxyethanol. Sodium Hydroxide. Disodium EDTA. Black 2.Chemicals of concern:Butylene Glycol, the third ingredient in this product is a potential irritant to the skin, eyes and lungs according to EWG.org Skin Deep Database.  I looked into this further as the information on the database was limited and found the Material Data Safety Sheet for Butylene Glycol.  Keep in mind this is an industrial safety sheet for proper handling, but also consider this is a chemical you are placing in your eye every day.According to ScienceLab.com's MSDS sheet it lists Butylene Glycol as:\"Potential Acute Health Effects:  Hazardous in case of skin contact (irritant), of eye contact (irritant), of ingestion, of inhalation (lung irritant).\"  If this is considered an irritant why have it in a product used around the eyes and have it as the third ingredient.I am surprised by this list given Physicians Formulas reputation as providing hypoallergenic products and disappointed.Having said this, there are going to be people who do not react to these ingredients for a variety of reasons, however, if you do have sensitivities be sure to read the product lists and do your homework on the ingredients, especially if using around the eye area."

"I use ELF's small stippling brush for this and it's enough to make me look awake at 5 am for work! It's really beautiful and I LOVE that the color is bold on my skin. I bought it in Diva and it's perfection. I can use my fingers and get the same effect. A little goes a long way so this is going to last me forever! I can see where it's kind of scary getting these darker colors for light skin but it can work as long as you know how to apply it. I think the complaints about it being too much on light skin is because of poor application. I'm definitely going to get some other colors."	"Shows up AMAZING on my olive skin"	"good"
"Well, it doesn't claim to be a makeup remover, and it's not. Even though other reviewers said so, it doesn't remove make up fully.It does remove eye make up easily, but my foundation only comes off about 80%. The cloth is soft, and softer than the olay regular make up remover cloths. Scrubbing with this cloth doesn't make my sensitive, acne prone skin red. It didn't worsen my acne, and left my skin feeling hydrated. Although, after I gave my face a quick rinse with water, my oily skin breathed better. I'm guessing people with dryer skin will love this.I use the total effects moisturizer so this will be in my kit when I travel. otherwise, I think I'll stick to my regular Olay clean effects for make up removal."	"Good for moisturizing, not make up removal"	"neutral"
"These had a lot of pluses. This was my first experience with false eyelashes, and application was far easier than I anticipated. The glue didn't have much odor and seemed to dry quickly. I liked that the glue changed color--it made it easier to apply. Removal was also relatively simple and painless. I have sensitive skin, and had no problems during the brief time I wore them. So no complaints there.Unfortunately, I looked completely ridiculous wearing them. It's not so much that I looked like I was wearing false eyelashes, although you could definitely tell up close. It looked like I had applied black liner halfway across my eyes and gave up right in the middle. This style is called \"barely there\" and that at least is right--my eyelashes are very pale red--pretty much invisible, and these did nothing to enhance them. The shape is definitely not natural, either. They are very long on the outside corner, then fade to almost nothing. To the extent you can see them, it looks stupid.So while the lashes themselves were disappointing, I'll at least have the glue handy if/when I try falsies again."	"Nowhere near long enough"	"bad"
"I tried this deep conditioner for the first time.  My hair is pressed with a hotcomb and is short (layered short around face)and very coarse. My hair for some months, didn't seem to want to smooth out, but stayed very thick and  frizzy.  Whenever I would straighten it out, I would go outside and the hair would go \"poof\".Anyway, I like the conditioner because, when it is applied to your hair and scalp, you immediately feel a cool and refreshed tingling sensation. The scent of the product is mild, not too perfumy at all.  It is very creamy and you receive a nice amount in the little packet. I generally sit under the hot dryer for about 20-30 minutes.  After having used this product for the 3rd week, I can honestly say I saw improvement, in the texture of my hair.  It was smoother and easier to handle, after using it. I am very pleased and will continue using it.I would recommend this product."	"very pleased"	"good"

"Love the smell and love the feel. The big test of any body lotion for me is how well and how long it lasts on my feet. I do use the product a couple of times each day and my skin is smoother and my feet are much softer, too.It's hard to judge how someone else would perceive smells, but I really like the smell of this, sort of warm and fuzzy opposed to fresh and light.My least favorite part of the whole package is the color of the container. It doesn't affect the effectiveness of the product, but it looks more like suntan lotion that a moisturizer. That's just a marketing thing, though."	"A Difference I Can Feel"	"good"
"I have straight, baby fine hair which has no body & is very soft. I am always interested in trying products which will give my hair some oomph.First I triedNexxus Youth Renewal Plump and Lift Blow Dry Spray, 7.5 Ouncealone. I sprayed it on my towel dried hair, combed it through, then held my head upside down & blew it dry. I didn't notice any extra volume, but my hair was shiny & the color was more vibrant. I haven't used the product long enough to vouch for  its claims to increase my hair strength. My baby fine hair is never frizzy so that's not an issue.The next time I used this product, I combined it withPaul Mitchell Round Trip Curl Definer, 6.8-Ounces Bottlewhich is meant to be used for curly styles but also works to give my hair body. I applied both products to my towel dried hair, combed through, held my head upside down & blew it dry. Eureka!  I finally  added some volume to my hair.  So, for me, this Nexxus product works if I use another product with it."	"Works if I use another product with it...."	"neutral"
"I really love this stuff but cant justify the price when I only used a couple times and it turned green. I called the makers of fake bake and told them what happened they didn't seem to care. Customer Service is lacking. Will not buy again. Swedish Beauty Botanicals has a great self tanner for the face and body, is cheap and smells great. It is also sold on Amazon for less 1/2 the price they sell at the tanning salons. I bought a tube that was 50.00 for 20.00  on Amazon."	"Turned green only used 3 times..."	"bad"
"I've ordered this cream before on the actual Avon site. But I found it to be cheaper on Amazon. The night cream is wonderful. Earlier in the winter season, I was going through a rough patch with my skin and dryness. I was using DHC before, and it works wonderful. But it was draining my pocket. So I did some research and remembered about Avon. I read the reviews and found that majority of the customers were satisfied with this cream. So I ordered me a trial size from the Avon website and viola, I ended up loving it too. I have combination oily skin, but this cream was just perfect for me. It gave my oily dry skin the moisture it needed without overpowering it with oiliness or stickiness that some night creams can give you. It absorbed right into my skin and within that week I saw my skin transform from dry flaky skin to smooth soft skin. Over time, it also helped smoothed out my wrinkles between my brows too; well with the help of my clarisonic. But this cream gave it an extra boost to smooth out my skin even more. Overall, I'm very satisfied with this cream and will highly recommend it."	"Wonderful Night Cream!"	"good"

"Shampoos aren't the most exciting products on earth to review, but it does help to know what you are buying.In this case, the 2 in 1 feature is great for anyone who deals with a child who hates to have his/her hair washed.  It is quicker and minimizes the amount of  parental trauma the rinsing process delivers when the shampoo & conditioner are combined.This particular shampoo is okay, having used it on myself to assess its initial performance.  It isn't so great with hair that tends to be oily, as the conditioners seem to be a bit on the heavier side.  For dry hair, I'd think it was an improvement over the average \"baby\" type shampoos.The coconut scent is pleasant and not overdone."	"Generally okay"	"neutral"
"The pigment on this color blush is so heavy and thick. If you make the mistake of putting on too much it is definitely a clown color on fair skin.  Consistency is also poor made me break out.  If this is NARS, it is highly overrated and definitely overpriced."	"horrible color"	"bad"

"The color I got says it's Channing, but it's not the same as in a magazine ad I saw and also this picture. I don't think it's the seller's fault, it's just that this particular color doesn't translate onto the screen well. It's much more coppery/orangey than in the photo and, while I still love it and it goes on great and it's a good color, it's not the one I wanted, but I will say the color on the online pic is way more accurate than the magazine pic I saw."

"Whether you have long or short hair, hot rollers are a great and easy way to create volume.  In my opinion, these Remington rollers work well but have many drawbacks.Pros-20 rollers! Thats a lot!Variety of roller sizesVelvet texture rollersHeats up quicklyClips heat up as wellProduces nice curls that you would expect from the average hot rollerClips store nice and neatly on the rollersPretty caseCons-20 rollers- Unless you want super tight curls, does anyone really need that many? I have thick, long (near waist) length hair and I didn't even use half of them to curl my hair.Clips are awkward- They don't allow the roller to hold tight to your head.  This causes the rollers to become floppy on your head and possible burns can result near the nape and ears. Clip combs would have been better.Huge!- Takes us a lot of space on the counter or in storage.Clips get borderline hot so you have to work quickly not to get burnedOverall these rollers did not work for me. They are just to awkward to clip and stay. I kept repositioning the clips to keep them from flopping all over the place. Maybe for someone with shorter hair."

"I was using it for about 2 weeks under my nose and a little off to the left side of my nose, because that is where my acne is worst. I followed the instructions and used it as described. After about 2 weeks, I began to notice numbness in the whole area that I used the Dark Spot Corrector. The area has been numb for a solid week now, and I stopped using the cream as soon as I noticed the numbness. It is not \"fully\" numb...another way to describe it is \"desensitized.\" It definitely does not feel normal and now I am worried about regaining feeling in my face!!!! I would NOT recommend using this product."	"Caused numbness on my face!!!"	"bad"
"This hand cream is smooth and light, and rubs in easily. It works right away to calm my dry hands and elbows. Also, the scent is really nice: just a light, fresh, slightly floral aroma. It does leave my hands a little greasy for a while until it's fully absorbed, so avoid trying to pick up anything fragile for a short time. I would recommend putting it on before bed and letting it work magic overnight. I also love that it is mostly chemical free, knowing that my skin is absorbing more pure and less harmful ingredients makes me happy."	"smells great, less chemical filling"	"good"
"I have used this foundation for years, as the shade (40) perfectly matches my pinkish-yellowish-neutral face color (my face color is hard to match since I'm mostly neutral but have both slight yellow and slight pink undertones). It blends in very well and provides natural looking coverage. It is sheer so won't cover blemishes, but I will sacrifice coverage for breathability. It isn't very moisturizing but that's not a problem since I always use moisturizer (day and night). I tried putting this on once without moisturizer and it was quite cakey and flaky. I do wish Neutrogena would get with the program and stop using parabens in Retinyl Palmitate in their lotions and cosmetics. Though I love this tinted moisturizer, I've stopped using it and switched to another paraben-free brand until Neutrogena finally removes known carcinogens and endocrine disrupters from their products. If you have a difficult to match medium skin color with both pink and yellow undertones and DO NOT mind parabens and RP, this would be an ideal tinted moisturizer for you...just be sure to use primer or moisturizer underneath."	"Great sheer foundation, just wish it was paraben & RP free"	"neutral"
"When I put this on it looked and felt just fine for a minute or two, and didn't bother my eyes.  But afterward, anything that touched my face made the cream roll into little balls of dark stuff, so all the sunscreen benefit was gone.  Other reviews don't say this, so maybe it was some combination of products I used or just my skin (which is pretty normal), but I've never experienced this with other tinted sunscreens or with make-up."

My hair still falling out like crazy, now is even more frizzy, the worse part is that I bought two of them, one for me and the other as a gift, but now I am thinking what to do!!! my friend is even older than me with hair problems and she doesn't like to use conditioner because her hair is thinning and the conditioner flats her hair down. Probably I'd give that to her because just because if it isn't good for me that doesn't mean it isn't good for her, I don't know???. I Won't buy it again."	"Probably is not for my type of hair???"

"I have been using Obsidian for the last year and really love the slight warming effect it provided.  I wanted to boost my tan and after researching tinglers, I decided to purchase Bombshell.  Whoa, this product is powerful!!  About 10 minutes into tanning I felt the tingling sensation start to work.  Right after tanning my body was completely red, especially my legs.  The tingle intensified and lasted a few hours later even after showering.  After the redness went away, I was darker, but it didn't sustain like I have seen with results from Obsidian.  This may be a great product for truly advanced tanners, but for me it was a little much.  I will use the rest of the bottle though and rotate it in and out with Obsidian since I want to use it up.  If you love tinglers you will probably really enjoy this product.  For me, just a little too strong."	"WOW tingle!"	"neutral"
"I was rather excited to receive  the Remington Smooth and Silky Electric Roll-On Wax kit from Amazon's Vine program in order to review it. For years I have been using sugaring, which is a similar depilatory practice, and so I thought it would be quite similar.The unit is packaged nicely, Looking at it you would think that this compact unit would make the chore of hair removal easy. The unit heated up quickly enough, however the wax did not stay warm enough for long.  It was very difficult to get it to stay on the skin long enough to get the &#34;fabric strips&#34; to adhere to the wax. These were more like dryer sheets. I was only able to remove a very little bit of hair at all from my legs. Finer hair, such as between the brows or on the chin were completely uneffected. If I am going to buy a device, take more time and effort in hair removal than it would take me to shave or even sugar - i want results.  This product did not offer enough of a tangible result.  So I cannot recommend it."	"Not effective"	"bad"
"I bought this as a gift for someone who requested an all natural soap with a clean, non-floral scent. This definitely hits all those marks - the ingredients are all plant based and it is scented by essential oils. There are no artificial scents or chemicals, and it does not contain parabens or any of those other nasty chemicals. The scent is great - although grapefruit and mint may sound a little strange, they go together very well and the scent is clean and fresh. A little pricey but definitely worth it if you want a good, all-natural soap."	"Smells great, and all natural!"	"good"
"The only problem with this mitt is that it is difficult to use in the shower. The &#34;handle&#34; needs to be more flexible (perhaps sizable?) to allow for a comfortable fit. As a massager, it is okay, but i am not convinced that it does anything for cellulite."	"So so"	"neutral"
"I was exited about getting this mascara because I had heard in some magazines that women all over loved it, but I was kinda annoyed when I saw that the brush was tiny and it really didnt do anything for my lashes, I recomend Milani Runway lashes mascara for about the same price but a much better product!"	"This Mascara is Crap."	"bad"
"I've been ordering this type of lash for a couple of years now.  I love that they come in all sorts of different styles, and I can order a different pair if my mood changes.  Plus, they are cheap, which is nice when you don't want to spend $10 a pair elsewhere.  That being said, they're not like ones you'll find in the stores.  These are a little thicker, and give you the very dramatic, obviously false eyelash look.  I've found they look best (on me) if you put a coat of liner on after their applied, to blend them in with your natural lash line.  I can usually wear one pair for about a week before throwing them away.  I just clean them with an eye makeup remover pad. As far as glue is concerned, I have had the best luck with either Revlon or Duo glue with the applicator brush.  I will for sure be ordering more in the future."	"Great for the price."	"good"
"This shampoo is great in that the smell is much less potent cough drop like than the original, actually almost pleasant, but the shampoo itself also seems less effective in managing a dry scalp.  I'd rather have the smell and have my shampoo do its job..."	"not the original"	"neutral"

This one is great!Even with the first washing my hair was more manageable, styled better, and was so shiney and bright! One of the guys I work with said it looked blonder and asked if I just got it done!I know it has sulfate but my hair looks great anyway!"	"This is a great shampoo"	"good"
"I wanted to like it, I really did but the red didn't do it for me. It's too glossy to be a red, it made a mess and did not line my lips at all. Treat it like a gloss. I am going to buy it in a different shade eventually because it still applies really nice and shines. It's just not what I wanted in a red color."	"Meh.."	"neutral"
"I usually use a regular manual eyelash curler but thought this might be of better quality.  Was hard to close the curler without pinching my eye lash area. Lashes didn't stay curled.

"Did you know that you can prevent all soap scum in your shower or tub by not using--wait for it--soap?  Use a body wash instead! I love the creamy feel of this particular body wash. It lathers very well, and it doesn't have a perfume-y sent.  I've tried many other brands, most quite a bit more expensive, but this is my favorite.  No other brands gives me such a nice, rich creamy lather.  It also works great as a bubble bath in the tub.  I love it when the best product also has the best price!I don't know why, but this is hard to find in stores.  Target is about the only place I can find it, but shipped to my door via subscribe and save is even better!"	"My favorite wash at any price"	"good"
"This is a large, nicely made brush, and a cruelty free product....but cruel to my hair.I keep trying to use it and have finally given up.  It pulls my hair and has gotten tangled twice while trying to use it with the blow dryer.  I do use other products from this brand of Ecotools but this is a reject for me and my longer hair.  They have so many great brushes for longer hair that smooth and don't get tangled but this is not one of them!"	"Not liking this one..."	"neutral"

"I read the previous reviews for this scalp balm; I'm glad that I decided to get it anyway. There are a number of ingredients in here that would make one think that this would be heavy, but it wasn't. As someone who deals with dry scalp, I'm always looking for hair/scalp oils to use. Sometimes, I  miss the mark and get something that weighs my hair down, and makes it overly oily. Considering that this is hair \"grease\" this was light and fluffy, compared to the others that I've  used. It had a pleastant smell, and didn't make my hair greasy. I put it in my hair 3 days ago, and I haven't had any itching. I will happily use tyhe rest of my sample and buy some more"	"Not heavy"	"good"

"These clear elastic bands are great because they don't stick out awkwardly against the hair color (due to their transparency). They're also handy because they don't tug and pull the hair when you remove them, like so many rubber bands have a tendency to do. They're a great price for the quantity you receive and a pack like this can last you a while. But of course the absolute best quality that they have is simply the fact that they're ouch-free. I have a sensitive scalp and the bane of removing elastic bands is often how difficult and painful it is to do so. These elastic bands leave the discomfort behind. I would highly recommend this product to anyone, but most specifically to those with sensitive scalps."	"Ouch-Free Bands"	"good"
"I work long hours... I used this to wash my face and hoped the cooling action would perk me up.  It did a good job cleaning my face (I have had better luck with Nivea products), and this left me refreshed.I did not feel the skin tightening I would feel with the Nivea products.  But the smell of this is pleasing and the cooling feeling perked me up."	"Cooling and a pick me up, but falls short"	"neutral"
"I must say that even though I read both the negative and positive reviews of Wen on Amazon, I still purchased the product from the infomercial. Well, I didn't really like the results. My hair is thin and curly naturally. My hair did feel a lot softer in the shower within minutes, but while it dried afterwards, I noticed it become limp and almost oily. I continued to use it for a few weeks to give it a chance and no change. I'm sure for some hair types it's a \"miracle\" product, but it did nothing for me. I ended up canceling my future orders and sending my unused portions to a friend."	"Not So Great"	"bad"
"Does what it's supposed to do.  Dries out my nail so the gel base coat can adher to my nail.  A little bit goes a long way so this bottle will last forever.  Over all the Harmony Gelish gel is a great brand.  It had nicer colors than the other brands I looked at, and what is really great about the brand is tht all of the instructions at on their website, and the curing times are on the bottles too.  Another brand that I looked didnt have any instructions posted on their website, and instead you would have to sign up for a class to Learn how to use the product.I love being able to do my nails my self on my own time!"

"I ordered this product to try and I have to say I am not sure how I feel about it.  It smells great but it makes my hair feel gross and it is hard to wash out. There was not directions on how to correctly use it so I have no idea how to use it. All the directions said were \"cleanse\", \"smooth\", \"soothe\" and \"seal- but i don't actually  know what that means. I think this product would be nice if there were actually directions on how to use it."	"it smells good"	"neutral"
"I love Bare Escentuals and use many of their products but this one did not work for me.  I have oily skin though I'm in my 50's and this exacerbated my break outs.  I wouldn't recommend it for others with similar demographics."	"Not good for oily complexions."	"bad"

"These rollers have the same great quality of my old Conair travel rollers from the 80s; however, the cheap plastic clips on these things will not hold your hair, that is unless you have  baby fine, thin hair,(I have thick course hair) then they may work. The metal clips I ordered after reading the reviews are too small, which leave the rollers almost unusable. I think I'm going to just sent them back rather than going through the trouble of searching for proper metal clips, like the old rollers used to have."	"rollers great-clips suck"	"neutral"
"OPI polish is always #1 in my book, and this color was no exception, I got a lot of compliments. BUT when it was time to change polish i literally had to buff this off my nail.

"These work as do the hair, skin, and nails softgels also by Nature's Bounty I have in my cabinet. But there's quite a difference in ingredients. Comparing the two labels, I find 3 softgels as the recommended dosage contain 5 mg of biotin vs. 2.5 for the gummie dosage. The gummies have 15 mg of Vitamin C and 15 IU of Vitamin E, whereas the softgels contain 60 mg and 15 IU respectively. The softgels contain many more vitamins and minerals; the gummies list only 4 grams of carbs and 2 grams of sugar as their other ingredients, tellingly.So, you can see that there's a dramatic difference in the biotin and Vitamin C dosages by these two Nature's Bounty products side-by-side. The softgels have 250 pills (3/daily) compared with the 80 gummies (2/daily) for additional information, so you can judge if you want the 15 calories of the gummies or the 10 calories of the pills--not much difference there!"	"How do they compare with Nature's Bounty softgels?"	"neutral"
"It has been OVER 5 Months since I used this product @ the shade stated above. I'm a natural light auburnish coppery warm red (almost strawberry blond but not quite that light). I am a former Hair Stylist that use to be able to buy/get so called professional products @ 1/2 price or cheaper but let my license run out so I've been trying different hair colors (to be very frank-most so called professional products ARE made by Loreal, they own tons of different products, take a peek on the internet as to what they do own if you want, it's just a little secret that the Beauty industry doesn't want u to know & I think u will be surprised to know how many come off the same assembly line). Anyways this review is for this Garnier Olia product only so I'll get to the point-just thought it was worth mentioning due to the fact that in my opinion they really went wrong with this stuff.I know how hard it is to keep any red shades in your hair looking nice & vibrant (yes-natural here but I still color it to make it look more vibrant & to cover some greys that are starting to poke through). This product is just a nightmare & it seems you are either going to love it or hate it from reading most reviews though it seems if you are using a brown(ish) shade the reviews are better or a lot better than the red or blonde shades. All I can say is \"this\" shade not only made my hair 2 shades darker than what I had it also has been over 5 Months as stated & it keeps getting darker! Yes, my roots are certainly popping up as my lighter natural hair color (so in between I used a semi-permanent color to even it out but \"that\" washed out. I know hair color can always be fixed but I certainly don't want to use a hair coloring stripper to get this junk out of my hair (but I may have too) @ this point. Unless I shave my head or get a really short cut this crap WILL stay in my hair. It just will not lighten up any other way & instead of a level 6 auburn I got a very dark black cherry shade with lovely purple highlights @ very cool toned (looks great with my pale/Casper the Ghost complexion -(yikes-at least the violet purple tones are out by now but now it's just a \"mucky\" very dark brown. I think this might be a \"metallic\" dye (such as Just For Men where the color gradually turns darker & darker for men that don't want that drastic hair color change kind of thing) but I'm not sure? All I know is I want this junk out..Does anyone have any other suggestions besides 1.shaving my head or really short cut (I'm serious here & it's been a while since I've done hair so I'm asking-I don't \"know\" it all), using a hair stripper, or the other thing i can think of is what we use to call a Shampoo cap-mixing 20V peroxide with=amounts of shampoo-leave it on 10-15 min. & wash it out/if it's still not lighter I could try it over once again but that's it because my hair is STILL damaged from this stuff. Okay so i guess it's a review on my part & also just simply asking the people out there that have has this same problem what they did to get it out? The only PRO I can think of is what everyone else says-no bad odor. i didn't find the bottle etc. very hard to use. I say try it if you have dark hair & that's it. Anything lighter than a med. to med. light brown you will not be happy with (I don't think)."	"Review is for 6.60 Light Intense Auburn-HORRIFIC SHADE? or PRODUCT IN GENERAL?"	"bad"

"I've never really used Axe product before as I'm more of an old school guy when it comes to soaps & shampoos, but I thought this bottle looked pretty cool and always wondered what Deep Space smelled like, so I thought I would give it a try.I will say that Deep Space smells pretty cool, kind of like new car scent mixed some citrus, so that's nice. And the soap itself is a cool shimmery silvery-white, which again is pretty cool. I also liked the way the Axe soap washed off without leaving a greasy residue on my skin (I hate those lotion infused soaps that leave you feeling unpleasantly moist even after drying off) and with 16 Ounces, the bottle should last you quite awhile.The only problem I had with the Axe product is that it doesn't suds up too well. When I'm in the shower I want a soap that will lather up a bunch of bubbles. Yes, I'm sure the Axe product is doing the trick, but I still like the feel and the idea of a rich, bubbly lather. The Deep Space Gel just kind of produced a small soapy film.If you're a fan of the Axe product, then I say give this new scent a try. But if you want to look like Mr. Bubble before rinsing off, you may want to grab something else."	"Love the Scent, But......"	"neutral"

"This conditioner claims that it is a conditioner,\" that feed your scalp and give you stronger, more beautiful hair in just 7 days\".I used it for 7 days. My hair is about 8 inches below my shoulders and at that length I really have to watch that it does not get in tangles and pull out. As I have gotten older my hair just does not seem to be as strong as it used to be (neither does anything else for that matter).After 7 days, using this in the same manner as other conditioners I normally use - ones that are on the lower end of the price scale, this does not work as good. I have more tangles in my hair and for that matter it just does not seem as creamy, even to the feeling on my skin as others.Also the bottle is fashioned to be stood `upside down' so that the opening is on the bottom. That is great in order to get all of the product out of the bottle and not to have to shake it to the top while you are waiting to use it; but the bottle then drips, so that it will wind up in a small pool of conditioner the next time you use it - not good in a practical sense and not really as effective as other conditioners that I have used."

"This is a lovely, light cream. I just used about a nickle's worth and spread it through my hair when it was damp.It smelled heavenly. It is light and fresh and really clean.

"I have very curly and coily hair. I usually have luck with conditioners and have been using Aussie Moist for about a year and wanted to try a change. Learned not to fix what isn't broken!This particular conditioner did absolutely nothing for my hair but make it smell good. I used it for about 15 minutes under a cap, no heat, and rinsed my hair with cool water, as usual. My very coily hair did not bend an inch! I was so very surprised! Water alone curls my hair but I had never experienced any conditioner to leave my curls looking so tacky and undefined. I think the conditioner actually uncurled my hair. It also did not feel too moisturized. I did not use the conditioner as a detangler so I cannot comment on slip, but the consistency is very thick (which I like for detangling) and the product smells nice. I am returning to Walmart and will not repurchase. (BTW, the shampoo version works wonders and is a staple for my hair! Odd huh?)"	"Not at all impressed."	"bad"

"I wasn't impressed with this hairdryer. The biggest turnoff was the weight, its so much heavier than the hairdryer i'm used to using, AND its not as powerful. you'd think more mass would equal more power, but not when it comes to this one against my goody(http://www.amazon.com/Goody-Heat-Flash-Blow-Dryer/dp/B006MRM2TC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1396414992&sr=8-1&keywords=goody+1911532) the goody wins.

"I've been using this cream daily for around 2 months and I haven't noticed any changes in my skin, although I certainly don't expect my fairly young-looking skin to transform magically back to skin like a 20 year old. I have sensitive, normal-to-dry skin and this moisturizes well enough for the summer, but I doubt if it will be enough to keep me hydrated when the furnace kicks on.  It goes on smoothly due to it having some silicone added, soaks in quickly, and doesn't dry sticky at all.However, I really hate the scent.  Maybe I'm a little more sensitive to fragrances in my skincare products than the average person.  The scent of this is herbal/medicinal, and it lingers way longer than I like it to.  And yes, it has SPF 25, I do applaud Olay for upping the SPF in this product over most of their others which have an SPF 15.This product has some parabens in it as preservatives, but I don't worry much about those.  I've been using skincare with parabens for 20 or so years, and they haven't hurt me yet.  What I don't like and it really upsets me is Olay still tests on animals when there is no reason to do this - there are plenty of other ways to test without having to dab this in the rabbits' eyes."

"I have had acne since I was 10 years old- I am now 21 and although some may argue it's a teenager thing I feel like I have had it quite long enough. I am VERY pale and the acne has left scarring which is very traumatizing in itself. I've tried just about everything for my skin- Skin ID (ps don't buy that it's OTC products you can buy at the store, just do the evaluation and it'll tell you what to buy :P) Proactiv, Zeno, every face wash on the market, steaming my face, 10% benzoyl, even prescription creams and antibiotics. Nothing worked, not even a little. I have pretty oily skin and my acne mostly consists of blackheads all around and small whiteheads around my cheeks/mouth/jaw and occasional large cyst like zits that never pop >:[ I decided to buy this peel in combination with the glyco/lac peel because so many people I know rave about how great the peels are. I did this one first, my skin is pretty tolerant to medications since I've had acne for so long so my first application I left on for 4-5 minutes, bad choice. It didn't burn bad until I decided to rinse it off and I blasted the cold shower on my face and the combination of the cold shower and my face burning was so intense I could barely breathe. A few minutes later the burning subsided and my skin suddenly didn't feel oily anymore, but not in a bad way. I used neutrogena healthy skin moisturizer and my skin felt great! I see no differences in acne yet but I also realize it needs to extract the acne before it can eliminate it. Even if it doesn't cure my acne completely the oil elimination is so nice I would buy it again. Giving it 4 stars because I have only used it once- will update! :]Update- 2 days later-Skin is slightly flaking, applying lotion often. Breaking out slightly but it is probably just the extraction. I also work out so maybe my sweating has something to do with the breakout although I did the peel post workout because it says not to sweat for a few hours after.2 weeks laterWow, this stuff really works! I bumped it up to using it 6 days a week then a week of the glycolic/lactic and it's amazing! It does get a bit sensitive around my nose but other than that I'd say 80% of my acne is gone!"

Two weeks later and I still have a dark spot.  To me this is a big deal.  I haven't broken out or had anything more than a minor blemish in YEARS.  After only using it for two consecutive days.  This product is TERRIBLE.  This was very upsetting as I have a very clear, smooth complexion. I have very prominent red undertones and do require foundation, however.

"So far I have tried 2 scents in the Sheer Illusion series, Vitamin Burst and Botanical Blend.  Unfortunately, Botanical Blend has an overpowering scent that makes it almost impossible to use.The scent is very similar to some Avon \"protecting\" lotion I got as a gift back in the early 1990s. I'm convinced that the \"Stratys 3\" protection Vaseline uses is the same thing. It's very unpleasant, kind of glue-like, and while the Vitamin Burst type is usable, the Botanical Blend scent is so strong (probably because they were trying to mask the glue-ish smell) that I just cannot use it.  My eyes watered, my allergies started to act up, and I tried to wash it off.  Ironically, the moisturizing is so good that it doesn't wash off quickly.  The protection is quite good, with a nice feel on the skin.  That's the reason I'm giving it 3 stars.  Scent is subjective and some people may not mind the scent."

I left this on my head for a few hours on a Sat am and rinced with cool water. It did absolutely nothing. I had to recondition it with something else. Could not recommend.

"Ok- so I was happy with this conditioner after I rinsed my hair in that it was still soft-- however, I didn't put anything on my hair afterward and let it air dry to see what the consistency would be like.  Well it remained soft and tangle free but boy was it dry and  fly away at the roots  (the relaxed ends looked silky and great but the roots and new growth--not so much)  I kind of expected more.  I later applied the Shea Moisture Hair Elixir Restorative oil and while it made my hair look a little better--it didn't restore it enough for me."	"Soft hair after the rinse out"	"neutral"
"First of all, I got this package with 2 random bottles of leaky oil in the box. They leaked and kind of greased up the box and package. WTH?! This already turned me off.

"Although intended for children, I use it on my own \"adult\" hair. This styling cream does wonders for my hair which is prone to frizzing in the summer humidity. I just add a small amount to my damp hair and style. To bring out my curls I apply it after a shower right before bed, perfect bedhead in the am. Thick and creamy, but does not leave my hair greasy like other products."	"Makes my hair delicious!"	"good"
"This feels great going on, and makes your skin refreshed. I have combination skin and when my skin feels particularly greasy, this soaks the oil up and make it feel less greasy for a couple of days. However, it smells a bit of spackle/clay/mud. It is a little messy getting it off (as they suggested, rub off with warm water and towel). I have also tried leaving it on my zits/pimples/itchy spots overnight, and I think it helps. If your skin is raw from winter/exfoliation, this may hurt a bit.Overall it is great for the price. It cleanse and make your skin feel refreshed, altho I have not seen a pore reduction.Update: unfortunately it dries up (i.e. color got darker and more difficult to get it out of the tube) after 2-3 years. It's still a good buy since it's so cheap ($3-4) and if you use it twice a week or something."	"Feels great, soak up oil, but dries up"	"neutral"
"I use Biore strips regularly so I was looking forward to trying this mask.  The application is fairly difficult.  The mask is very thick and hard to put on.  I got the mask all over the place which I was not happy about.  It took too long in my opinion to get the mask slathered all over my face.  My normal mask goes on smoothly which I prefer.  With that said, as difficult as it is to get the mask on, it is just as difficult to get it off.  The heat aspect of the mask only lasts a couple of minutes and I don't think the heat really did anything.  I am disappointed with this product because I love using the facial strips.  If you need a good mask then just search for one on Amazon.  I use one that starts with &#34;Queen&#34;. I am sorry I don't remember the exact name of the mask but if you search for it you will see it has great reviews."	"Not my cup of tea"	"bad"
"I bought this just to get the lip colors and blushes and am very pleased.  My lipsticks last a year or longer so I really don't need much.  Would rather have the variety and less product.  I also prefer the smaller size as the larger ones are overkill, are more difficult to manipulate, and take up too much counterspace.When I get tired of this in a year or so, I'll pass it on to my granddaughters who will be thrilled with the sparkly alternatives.I routinely buy many of NYX's new products because their price is so affordable and the company is wonderful to deal with.  One of my Christmas orders was smashed by UPS and NYX promptly sent a full replacement.  I complained when their website malfunctioned and lost my order and they gave me a $10 coupon.  Highly recommend NYC."	"Worth the Price for the Lip Colors Alone"	"good"
"I made a mistake getting this, as it's for fine, limp hair.  I have thick hair with lots of body.  I found that if I used a smaller amount, I could not comb through my hair.  A larger amount allowed me to comb through easily, but weighed my hair down.  On the other hand, it's really great to shave my legs!  Really leaves my legs soft :)"	"I like it, but not for the purpose intended."	"neutral"
"This is the kind of product where if I bought one and it turned out to be a gimmick of some kind, I would feel really extra duped. I assume I'm not the only one.Say I bought a new box of crackers that the manufacturer stamped \"NEW RECIPE! NOW LIGHTER AND WITH BETTER FLAVOR!\" and I took these \"new and improved\" crackers home and gave them shot. If I disagreed and thought the crackers were not, in fact, \"lighter and better flavored,\" I'd probably shrug my shoulders and buy a different brand next time.Not so with beauty products and their extravagant claims.In my time I've tried many beauty products and found quite a few that live up to their claims of \"smoother, better looking skin\" and \"shinier, bouncier looking hair.\" I've also tried a few duds that changed my appearance absolutely zero. I buy more of the products that work and look for alternatives for the ones that don't.However, I believe there is a special place in hell for the gimmick product that isn't looking to convert a customer for life but make a quick buck off of enough women buying their quack-juice product 'just once.'In my opinion, this Envyderm is quack-juice in a tube.Getting this product was taking one for the team. I'd order one, give it a really long trial, and then report back so that others wouldn't be duped or could know this was the real deal. Results in as little as 2 weeks, they said? Well, I'll try it longer than that and let everyone know.Just to make sure I wasn't seeing things and telling myself I saw results in the mirror that were no more than wishful thinking, I decided my trial of the product would be a scientific as I could be in my home bathroom. I applied the serum to only one of my two eyes and for good measure, dabbed a bit on my eyebrows in the areas where they are thinner. I figured if Envyderm worked, I could always begin applying to both eyes to make things even. Having uneven eyelashes for a while would be my second chance to take one for the team.I never got the chance, because nothing. I saw absolutely nothing.No gain in thickness.No gain in length.No gain in density.No gain in quantity.No gain in darkness.Nothing.I'm here to report that after 5 whole MONTHS of continuous use I saw absolutely no change in my eyelashes in any form whatsoever.I was lucky that I din't have to pay for my tube. As a Vine reviewer I could choose one from a list of interesting looking books, a kitchen scale for measuring perfect portions, or this serum. I wish I had gone with the scale."

"I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes, but boy was I in for a surprise when I found out how good this product really was.I'm the type that is very skeptical when it comes to products that claim to be great and amazing or all these other things, so you can imagine my surprise when I finally used this product and saw that it was better than I expected. My eyes popped the moment I looked into the mirror.Bombshell is a perfect name for this mascara because when I used it, I felt like a Bombshell HOTTIE! I was shocked and amazed that the brush actually glided on my eyelashes with no clumps or left over residue like most mascaras do nowadays.I typically go for a natural look because I feel it looks better on me than anything else, so originally I thought this mascara was going to be wayyyy to much for my simple little look. NOPE. It matched perfectly. My eyelashes were bigger, bolder and more beautiful than ever before. I couldn't stop looking at my eyes and neither could anyone else for that matter.Now, of course, everything always has it's cons, and yes, this mascara does BUT I don't feel the need to actually comment on anything because the pros outweigh everything.I'll be sad when my free sample runs out, but you best believe you can find me at the nearest beauty supplier standing at the checkout counter with a few more in my hand!I definitely recommend to those of you who are looking for a better mascara. You won't regret this buy!"	"My eyelashes thank you!"	"good"

I waited several weeks for it and I finally got it today, I opened it up and noticed some stray brush hairs so I gently brushed them away and then there were more, I had chunks of brush hair in my hand!  My brand new brush is practically bald and I haven't even used it once! It's like they weren't secured in the brush very well.... I am pretty disappointed. All of the reviews were pretty good, the price was great.... I guess I just got a faulty brush."	"Balding Brush."	"bad"
"I had been a faithful user of Biolage's Ultra Hydrating shampoo and conditioner for a couple of years. I liked how my hair felt but noticed that my hair started falling out. My hairdresser even noticed how thin my hair had become. She recommended No Poo for my wavy, frizzy hair and WOW what a difference! My hair stopped falling out and became thick and full again. I still struggle with frizz, but it's not anywhere near as bad as it was before. It was odd getting used to, but I absolutely love how my hair feels when using this product. I am able to use it pretty much every day and I don't notice any buildup. In fact when my hair is feeling gunky and gross from styling products, this is able to clean it up quite well while leaving it moisturized. I have tried other shampoos since using No Poo, but I always go back to it. My hair feels much better, and looks much better, using a product that doesn't lather."	"amazing product that restored my hair"	"good"
"I got this because my 10 year old daughter use this because she just started breaking out in pimples.  They've turned up on her forehead by the hundreds.  Okay, that's an exaggeration, but there are a lot of them.  She's been very good about not picking at them.  She started using the wash and did use it for about one week.  She stopped because she said it didn't work. Yes, I know, a week is not long.  But when you are a child with pimples popping up on your forehead a week is forever!I found something else for her to use and that has decreased the appearance of the pimples. So, not sure if she had continued to use the product maybe it would have helped.  That's why the three stars.  I think the length of time for effectiveness is important especially when dealing with pre-teens and teenagers."	"I let my daughter use this"	"neutral"
"I was hoping so much I would like this as others of its kind are pretty pricey but it left my hair feeling dirty. I used it for a couple weeks off and on but just could not like it.

"My daughter dyed her hair way too much this past year. She used some dye that was pink and it fried her hair. She used this and it has helped a bunch. It has restored a softness that wasn't there before. I recommend this for white and black hair."	"helped my daughter's hair"	"good"
"They're good for beginners who don't want to spend a lot of money on falsies. They don't look very natural, but if you have dark hair and wear eyeliner, they could pass.Before you put them on, cut off the excess band on the sides and make the band flexible by bending it a little bit so it's easier to put onto your eye."	"Okay."	"neutral"
"Maybe its because I have sensitive skin but even when I was a teenager fighting acne this stuff was too harsh for my skin.

"My hair has been bleached blonde from it's natural deep brown color. And my hair is very thick and long. So between my hair being bleached, it's length and it's the thickness, my hair ends up a huge poofy mess if I don't tame it before and after blow drying it.I'm always looking for a great product that i can use with my flat iron to give my hair back the shine that bleaching has taken away. Some hair oils are nice, but end up being too oily or make my hair completely limp. This Suave Infusion Oil gives my hair just a light touch of oil to give it back it's shine, but doesn't over do it to make my hair limp or greasy. I especially like applying it to the ends of my hair where my hair is it's driest. A few spritz of this and some passes of the flat iron over my hair and my dry poofy hair is tamed and shiny again.So if you are like me and you've got bleached hair and you're looking for a nice light oil to help give our hair back it's shine, without making it look greasy, this Suave Infusion Oil is an awesome choice."

"I got this blend because the regular Designer Whey products are wonderful. I've used them for years, they are healthy protein blends, they work well for me, taste great, and support my blood sugar well. The only reason I ventured into this one was its appetite suppressing feature.It's awful. It's not even remotely on par, flavor-wise, with the regular vanilla blends. It smelled like a chemical when I opened the container, and only went downhill from there. One of the hallmarks of DW is that it virtually vanishes in liquids, without a lot of manual blending. It shakes in quickly, disappears in smoothies in seconds. Really good stuff.I let this stuff sit for about 5 minutes, and it still didn't blend. It remained goopy, gritty, and generally unsavory. I couldn't even finish it. Perfect waste of almond milk.I recommend the regular line of DW products, though this one isn't very good. It may fully comply with its claims of appetite suppression, I just never could get a whole serving down to find out.If you can't have soy, this has a good bit in it. Also, it takes 2 scoops of this smaller container to make one smoothie, where the regular line requires only 1. On the surface it seems cheaper than the original blends, though there's less in the container, and you are required to use more per serving to meet the nutritional requirements it touts."	"Awful"	"bad"
"I think it may be too soon to tell if there are any 'dramatic' effects, but I honestly think this is great.  I use it on my face and neck nightly, and the directions mention the back of the hands, too.  I'm confident that there are positive effects on my face and neck because I can SEE a really positive effect on my hands.I use other Watts Beauty items and will definitely continue to purchase this."	"Great!"	"good"
"I have used hot rollers since high school (about 20 years) but I have always used the ones with the wire pins to hold them in.  This set uses clips to hold the rollers.  This took a bit of getting used to but I personally liked the clips much more than the wires.  I use rollers for large waves in my long hair and the clips are perfect for this. I can't get the clips to hold the roller in close to my head, if you like your rollers set that way, this may not be a good set for you.I found these rollers heated up within a few minutes and as expected, set my hair within 5 minutes.  There was nothing fancy about the rollers themselves, they are your basic hot roller with one difference.  Unlike previous sets, the heating rod does not go through the bottom of the roller but through the side.  This means you need to be careful how you grasp them or you could get burned.  Because they sit on their side, this set also takes up about twice as much space as conventional hot rollers so if your counter space is limited, you may want to look at a different set.This set comes with 12 large rollers and 8 medium rollers.  There are no small rollers.  This is another feature I liked.  I never used the small rollers and mostly just use the large ones.These are basic no-frills hot rollers.  They work well and heat up quickly.  On the downside, they take up a lot of room and there is the potential to burn your fingers."	"A no-frills set of hot rollers, mostly good a few cons"	"neutral"
"I thought this would have been a good detangling tool for my natural hair but i thought wrong. I modified the brush by taking out every other row of the brush and i still couldn't get it through my hair. I rather stick to my wide tooth comb. This brush almost ripped my hair out even when i was detangling with loads of conditioner in my hair."	"dont care for this brush"	"bad"
"I have been using this for over a year now. I don't think I will ever not use it when doing my nightly face routine. I feel like it gets all of my makeup, oil, and dirt off my face leaving it clean and smooth for my creams. I highly recommend!"	"Great for nightly routine"	"good"

"I was excited to try this product since I had heard so many good things about it.  I was very interested in the mix of the two products and how they blended together.  My first application was not a great one.  I was running late that morning so I applied it a little quicker then normal.  It had a little bit of a silky consistency but I had the hardest time blending it in.  The texture was terrible on my skin it did not blend well at all and you could see a line of makeup on my jawline no matter how hard I tried to blend it in.  The color was a little off for me.  I usually never go wrong with CG classic tan no matter what the product is.  I tan a couple days a week and spray tan mostly to keep up the color.  This product was more orange then the other classic tan foundations I have used in the past.  It did not have a natural look to it at all and you could tell I had foundation on it did not look right on me.  It might just be the texture of my skin I have combination skin and I can get greasy throughout the day and this did not help that matter at all.  I am sure it works fine for some people but I just could not get it to work for me."	"Not my favorite..."	"bad"
"I like the Mineral Foundations for Summer, particularly hot, sultry days.  When I use the Mineral foundation I don't feel like my face is sliding off. (you know what I mean) What I didn't like about Minerals was the little shimmer the ones I tried seemed to have.  MK Mineral doesn't appear to have this problem, which is good as shimmer makes my pores scream &#34;HERE I AM&#34;.  The product goes on smoothly, and comes out of the container easily. (You'll need your own brush as none is included)  It has a cool little open/close twisty thing on the top that keeps the product from spilling out when you aren't using it if it accidentally turns upside-down. Great idea!!  I like a sheer coverage, but I think like most Mineral's this will build for those who like more.  I haven't noticed any scent, but honestly, scent doesn't bother me as it seems to bother some. While I still love my cream foundations, I really like this Mary Kay's Mineral and will be using it a lot through the Dog Days of Summer!  All that and a great LOW price, you can't go wrong."

"For a line that is (for the most part) pretty organic, and doesn't have too many unnatural chemicals in it, this frizz be gone has a good amount of silicone in it.

"It lathers better than most sulfate-free shampoos I have tried. And it smells delightful. Organix is also a little cheaper than the sulfate-free products I had been purchasing. I wish it left my hair a little smoother, but I guess that's the price you pay.Sulfate-free products tend to vary from person to person JUST like any other product. Very few people find a \"miracle\" in the same product. However, something I have observed is that people with thick and/or coarse hair (particularly African-American hair) do not seem to have good experiences with Organix. My hair is color treated, oily at the roots and dry at the ends. Overall it is fairly healthy though. It's thin (not what I would call baby fine) and naturally wavy. I rarely heat style my hair, especially during the summer months. So I wash, oil, and braid until my hair dries.  When I do straighten it out, I notice it is slightly dryer with sulfate-free products than if I had used something like Biolage."	"So-so"	"neutral"
"This bottle came and smelled so vile that I had to leave it on the porch! After a few days I could bring it inside.Not sure what caused that, as there was nothing unusual about the packaging. The conditioner's smell also is unappealing (though not as bad). As a conditioner, it worked fairly well,smoothly out tangles and leaving hair shiny. But it's hard to imagine anything gentle and \"nourishing\" would smell like this."	"Okay conditioner, but...the smell!"	"bad"
"Just For Me Hair Milk Conditioner is recommended for all natural hair types. However if you have coarse or dry hair give this a try.

Plus you will notice your child's hair will be easier to comb through. I absolutely love this conditioner and I am sure you will too."	"An Amazing Hair Milk Conditioner !"	"good"
"I have used it 2 times now. First time I left it just under 2 minutes as a test to see how the skin reacted. Quite painful, but fine after rinsing. Second time left a little over two minutes. Had been tanning the day before and in spite of spf 30 and 50 got some sun freckles - those were almost completely gone after the peel. Skin did look clearer, but I did not see any difference in the fine lines. I see about the same improvement (or maybe more) with the Olay microdermabrasion/peel combo and it is much less painful. But will continue with this peel once a week, maybe give it another 3 or 4 times and later judge if it is worth the pain.A note to the people who have had problems - you have to know your skin and use common sense. I know my skin is not sensitive at all and I also did a spot test before the first time just to be sure. I also have had high concentration glycolic peels for acne as a teenager and I know my skin can tolerate it. If you have sensitive skin and have never used a peel before you should probably not use this product or at least not start with such a high concentration. To lower the concentration you can just mix with water and the bottle has the proportion guidelines, so you can try that as well. Time is also key. Don't assume you know better and leave it on your skin for too long, instead of looking better you can burn yourself and look worse.. as it seems has happened to a few people.A good tip is to use a clean foundation brush to apply so you don't get it on your hands."

"Hate it...thought I would love it because it is Dr.Bronners. There is no coconut smell, just over powering lavender.

"Instant moisturizing at the first use and steady hydration improvements when used twice a day. 2-3 pumps covers the face, neck, decolletage. This product gives cosmetic counters' serums a run for the money for many times cheaper.Results: The lines on my neck are less noticeable. My face  feels softer and the plumping action has started on my cheeks. I wake up to a soft, dewy complexion instead of the either dry (no moisturizer the night before) OR oily (too rich a moisturizer the night before).There were no sensitivities, irritation or breakouts. I look forward to continued use product to obtain maximum benefits.How Used:PM- I wash and massage my face, neck and decolletage with my facial cleanser TWICE to get rid of makeup and regular skin pollutants, Rinse thoroughly. Tone with toner/astringent. Apply this skin gel/serum and call it a day.AM- Shower, Rinse thoroughly, Tone with toner, Apply gel/serum let it dry before applying sunscreen or makeup.

Nevertheless, the price is still higher than a cats back, and should be lowered to the price of a small steak maybe?????"	"The worlds biggest Ripoff"	"bad"
"I wear bangs and have found other similar products leaving my hair oily. This oil does not.  My skin drinks in this Glow Renewal Facial Oil and doesn't leave it feeling greasy.  It also makes my skin feel so soft and supple, and full of moisture. This effect lasts all day.  It only takes a few drops morning and night, so it's a great buy for the money.  I'm loving it."	"Wonderful facial oil"	"good"
"Love the eyeliner - goes on easily - is soft, and stays well.  The mascara - almost seemed old and gloppy - not for me.  Will stick with the eyeliner!"	"Eyeliner Great! Mascara - not so much"	"neutral"
"Well, I used the product with high hopes, following the steps as directed, and the first couple of times, my face felt pretty good. Steps one and two made my face feel ultra-clean--dry really--and the moisturizer made it feel good. Soon, however, my skin started to burn, itch and hurt and it had the texture of sandpaper. Ouch! Too bad it didn't work for me. I'll hand it down to my son, maybe he can get some use out of it. But I am skeptical, because I don't think he would have the patience and diligence to follow the steps and do the whole program, as it is meant to be used. If you are reading these reviews and considering buying this product, I am sure that you are motivated to give it a fair try. That's the only way you can know."	"a disaster for my middle-age super oily skin"	"bad"
"My teenage son likes this Wet Shine Gel. He has hair that is about 2 inches on the top of his head, and he uses this to give it the wet look. It really makes his hair look shiny. He uses it on his hair when it's dry, so it gives it a little bit of a sleek look. The fragrance is a citric kind of smell, but it's not over powering, but it has a very nice clean refreshing smell, that doesn't linger. It holds his hair perfectly without being sticky. He is a very big fan of AXE products, and this one is on top of his list."	"Great hold, but not over powering fragrance"	"good"
"I have split ends and have tried many things to try to manage this issue. This shampoo, although it cleans well, had no effect on my split ends.

"If you have light to medium skin tone and want a lighter foundation to build color with bronzer and blush then this is NOT for you. if you want an all over color that brings the darker shade of your skin out then this does it. I found that this went on really smooth and looked like the darker pigment of my skin but I don't like that, I like a foundtion 1 shade lighter than my skin so I can contour and bronze and so my skin has dimension. It does have a great look and I almost kept it but I gave it to my sister that tans (I don't) and she loves it.Some people will love it and some won't. I love ALMAY brand though cause I have very sensitive skin and I have never had problems with this line and I always do with products. I wish they would come out with more sensitive skin foundations. I do love Maybelline \"Pure Makeup\" it looks really natural and light for a heavier coverage I like Revlons Colorstay. It covers well but never looks cakey on me EVER.."

"I was reading all the comments and though to myself wow,ok,i would give it a try.I was so excited to try it out.Turn out,it made my hair look like a total joke.Like seriously,it burns my hands,and this is not even my first time using it,it doesn't hold curls well.C'on people,save your time and money,and go buy you a HOT TOOLS curling iron,pay a bit more,but the quality is excellent."

"Shipped and delivered as promised = FAST! The seller emailed me 5-04-14, to ask if I wanted to review the product and offered these extra tips:+ \"Apply your Vitamin C Eye Gel 1/2 inch or so above your upper lash line and below your lower lash line, then while you're sleeping,it will travel on its own and stop right around your crows feet, where you wanted it in the first place!+ Be sure to use your ring finger to apply it (its your weakest finger so you wont pull too hard) and after making the dots, gently pat them in.+ In addition to nourishing your skin from the outside, you also need to take care of it from the inside. Eating healthy and drinking lots of water can help....+ Get 8 hours of sleep so that all of your organs, including your skin, have time to renew. Include night creams in your regimen to aid in skin toning and wrinkle reducing.\"As a 52 year old healthcare professional and a skincare marketer's dream consumer, (i.e., I've shelled out $ and time trialed everything from drugstore offerings to La Prairie; health food blends to dermatologist exclusives) I feel 15 faithful days of use is not long enough to adequately review the full potential of Bonapiel Vitamin C Eye Gel or other similar serums. My observations to date are: #1  The pump container is less than predictable in that it dispenses a fairly forceful squirt! The gel liquefies further upon contact with body temperature skin--think watery! The one pump amount varies from baby pea-sized to regular pea-sized; very small but sufficient to cover upper eyelids and the under eye socket area of  both eyes. I've learned to \"thump\" the bottom of the container against the palm of my hand to eliminate air pockets and, I keep my ring and middle fingers of the hand I'm dispensing into very close to the nozzle so I don't share any product with my bathroom sink!  #2  The gel reduced my under eye puffiness after the first use. If someone saw a before and after picture I don't think it would be a dramatic visual, but I could see a difference and, more importantly, feel it. #3  As for the purple-rust colored, 180 degree, Italian heritage (thanks Nonna) circles that look like I have on brown eye shadow 24/7? I cannot swear that I've seen much improvement. (Optimistically) slight fading would be my honest answer after only 2 weeks.I will use the entire bottle, update this review at a future date and consider repurchase. IF.. this product works cumulatively, taking good short term effects to awesome long term results, THEN...I'm sold!UPDATE MAY 24, 2014: There is still approx. a week to 10 days worth of product left in my bottle. BUT, after THIRTY-FIVE DAYS of vigilant 2X a day use, I see NO IMPROVEMENT IN DARK CIRCLES! Sigh! On the plus side, the gel is effective at immediate reduction of puffiness. Fine lines are slightly diminished when used in conjunction with eye specific moisturizers. Okay product but not convincing enough to make me want to add Bonapiel to my eye care arsenal. Not a repurchase for me!"	"NOT the MIRACLE I had hoped for!"	"neutral"

"When this mascara first came out, it was incredible. It was just the right consistency, making my lashes very long and thick, but not clumpy. It held curl like a dream and my eyelashes were like lush fans. I used it for a couple of years and enjoyed having wonderful lashes. However, I like trying new things so I was using other products for a while. A few months ago, I was out of mascara so I bought another tube of LashBlast. I could tell right away that it was not the same formula. It was clumpy, very wet, and it weighed down my curled lashes. It took a while to comb out my lashes so that I could look presentable. After drying, I tried to put on another coat because in spite of the clumps, there was no volume or length happening. Big mistake. More goopy mess to deal with.I thought that maybe I was a little out of practice, so I tried using it for several days in a row. No improvement. It was also possible that I purchased a stale tube, so I went to a different store and bought another one. Unfortunately, the results were the same.This was an amazing mascara, but this is no longer the case. Why do companies change products that are already wonderful? Is anyone else experiencing the same thing with this product? Good mascara is hard to come by, especially for those of us with very straight, pale blonde eyelashes. Change it back, Covergirl!"	"Used to be the best, but the formula has changed in the past year"	"neutral"
"The powder is fine, just the right tone for my skin. BUT... the compact design is horrible. It's divided into moveable sections and the mirror is under the powder and puff, so that you can't look in the mirror while you apply the powder. I have to keep an oldCover Girlcompact in my makeup kit so that I have a mirror. Don't design people ever try to use their products?!? And why put a round well in a square container -- it just adds to plastic waste. The compact is both consumer and environment unfriendly. Will not buy again unless the design is changed."	"Powder fine, compact design is the worst"	"bad"
"I love my tools to make dots on my nails. Easy to use and easy to clean. Very practicals. I'm very happy with my purchase."	"I love them!"	"good"
"This works well with my Clarisonic face brush. By itself, however, it doesn't really do its job - it doesn't remove makeup or leave your skin feeling clean."	"gentle, does not remove makeup"	"neutral"
"This should be labeled as a tinted moisturizer rather than a sunless tan lotion.  It has done nothing for tanning my face.  Underneath a bronzer powder makeup, it'll help make my face look tanner but then it's back to it's normal color, once washed off."	"S/be tinted moisturizer"	"bad"
"This is a great product which can be used under your makeup, which I have been doing for a few days. It works really well for this because it is not heavy. I've also been using it before I go to bed. I haven't had any bad reaction to it and my skin looks more refreshed. I also like that my skin is getting it's needed nutrients to help make me look the best that I can."	"Great Product!"	"good"
"I decided to give this product a try since it had so many great reviews. However, I was a little disappointed in the size of the bottle and the strength of the scent. Granted, I don't want to attract bees with it's sweet smell, but I hoped it would be a little stronger. It does have a sweet honey scent, when I can smell it. I used the product as directed on the instructions (thank you for that!) but the scent still seems shallow. I will continue to use it as directed and see if anyone can pick up the smell. On a positive note, adding sample perfumes really works. I would like to try one of the perfumes with the pheromones. We shall see."	"Smells nice....when I can smell it."	"neutral"
"Smells like children's tylenol, and is very greasy. Besides that I have nothing to report yet, will update after a few uses. Great packaging though.Update: think it is the packaging that is behind that originally huge price-tag. There are too many emmollients  (minral oils, vaselines) in this for it to be high quality because they cause the product to just form a film on the skin. This may be protective and therefore preventive, but I recommend mixing it with another lotion or sunscreen. Used underneath other lotions meant to penetrate, such a rich night cream, this serum with hinder absorption. It needs to be mixed. use the back of your hand and rub in the extra there to add niceness to your hands! Also this serum is likewise excellent as a primer for around the nose and upper lip. It fills in pores and small lines without being absorbed, so it can smooth out skin under a foundation which is also meant to sit on the skin. If used entirely by itself at night or AFTER everything else has sunk in completely, it will be very slippery, almost like their is a silicone in it. I'll checK the ingredients and find out! Update to come real soon!"	"First 2 week review"	"bad"
"Love this product. Here's why:1. It's so soft. It glides across my face and doesn't feel prickly the way animal hair brushes can.2. It holds product well so there is no misplaced fall out. Everything stays in place.3. Very easy to clean. Dries quickly afterward too and it doesn't shed.4. It is substantial. The base and length of the... shaft... handle? uhh... anyway... makes it very easy to control.5. The price. For what this product is and how amazingly well it works, it's worth more. How lucky are we.I definitely recommend it."	"Great item!"	"good"
"I am porcelain skinned- (very fair) and found this a little dark and blotchy looking on my skin. I got it at the same time I bought Bare Minerals and am so impressed with that, that I dont really need anything else with it anyways. Maybe this stiff works well for some, but as for coverage- I dont think its too great."	"Not too impressed..."	"neutral"
"What I like about this palette is variety of shades & that was the only reason that I decided to give it a try. My skin tone doesn't remain same for the whole year & also I have under eye circles(very light but visible) & blemishes around nose so I liked the idea that I can mix 2 or more shades differently to even out my skin.It arrived in good condition & I liked the shades. I was so excited to try it but I had to disappoint.First, It doesn't give full coverage. I mean concealers are to cover imperfections in yr skin & this product doesn't work as it is supposed to.Second, it is too dry for my skin. I have normal to dry skin. I always apply good moisturizer whether I am wearing makeup or not. So what  I did, I add a little moisturizer with shade mix & then apply it on my imperfection. So that way it worked for me but definitely I am not happy with it's dryness.Third, Because of it's NOT creamy texture it doesn't blend well into my skin.So I won't recommend this item."

"I am African American w/chemical free 4a/b hair. Detangling my hair could be a bit time consuming. Using my modified Denman Brush felt a little like I was pulling my hair out. The tangle teezer goes through my hair with ease, and it doesn't hurt. Now I realize I wasn't completely detangling my hair w/the denman & comb. I am able to brush through from root to end,with no problem. The brush elongates/strecthes my hair. Pulling my hair back into a pony tail is easy now. I would never brush through dry hair, now I can brush wet or dry. This is the best brush I've ever used. Must have for all naturals"	"I'm in love with this brush"	"good"

"Great for keeping my unrulies in line! When I'm feeling lazy, the best eyebrow combo is some brown eyeshadow, an angle brush and this bad boy.Not as great as some waterproof brow mousse options, but for a quick something to spice up your eyebrows...this is great.I don't use it on my lashes though. Alcohol=Drying out my roots and I have such baby lashes as it is..I don't need to upset them."	"Just what the eyebrows ordered"	"good"
"First of all, I felt compelled to write a review on this specific product because in no lifetime should this curler/straightener cost over $200. I have attempted to contact the seller and received no reponse regarding the price--I just wanted to know if this was really the price, or if it was a typo. But no response.Anyway, the reason I titled the review as I did is because I've used this product for ten years or so, off and on. And it's the best out there for both straightening and curling when it's a brand new device. The last time I ordered from Amazon, it was a refurbished model, and it was falling apart within a year. I didn't notice in the product description any mention of it being refurbished, so wherever you get this product, be mindful of this possibility, especially now that it has been discontinued.***06/10/2013 EDIT***I bought this back in March when I found a seller who had one for a reasonable price. I bought it and was immediately dismayed. The quality simply wasn't what I was accustomed to from Conair. My hair would snag between the straightening plates, which is something that never happened before. I decided to keep it because I liked the curls, but this weekend, the whole gizmo popped apart; the tiny screw on one side came out, fell into the oblivion of my tile, and now, the unit is inoperable.I don't recommend buying this product again. After two failed attempts in the past year, and paying good money for them, it's just not worth it. I don't know what happened to the quality but save your money. Not even the seller of this item is willing to help me now."	"Great product if purchased reputably"	"neutral"
"I read in InStyle magazine and in Women's Day that this product is \"the best and greatest\" product available to treat coarse, dry and finer hair. Supposedly it was going to make your hair sleek and pretty. Not so much. Not so much it all. I WISH I had Googled it before and read the posts below. :(I have very curly hair that's on the dry side. This product completely fried my hair, damaged it, burned my scalp and I reek of the smell of the 20-min Smooth it serum. It was the most horrible experience in my life and I have done salon relaxers, straighteners, at-home-kits, used many companies and I am very disappointed. At least it was only $10! This product is a two-step system, where after you shampoo and towel-dry your hair, you put the 20-min serum all over your hair (with gloves!) and then wait for 20 mins for it to soak in. Then rinse and put in the cream. After which, you blow dry. When I was rinsing off the serum, my hair felt heavy, thick and all in one glob, so I thought maybe something worked. After I towel-dried my hair, it was lifeless, sticky and even noticed one strand was slightly a different color (lighter). I don't have highlights or colored hair, either (and have never done either). I thought the \"perfect it\" cream (step 2) would work. It smelled MUCH better than the serum, but it did absolutely nothing. When I blow dried my hair it wouldn't dry at all. It's been 10 hours and it's still wet! My hair has more frizz in it now than I ever have had.The worst part of the whole thing was that my scalp was completely burnt. I reeked of the pungent serum smell and itched all over my scalp and my shoulders. I had to take another shower and re-wash my hair and super conditioned it with my normal conditioner. My hair is not any better but at least I don't stink and my head doesn't itch as much.I would wish this product on my worst enemy. Don't recommend it at all. :("	"Awful, don't buy this!"	"bad"
"Have tried some others...and they all left me wanting more power. NO WAY was I going to use my Dremmel on my thick toe nails..... This little gem works great. AC power means not low powered battery units and no constant recharging of batteries.It comes with a very nice selection of attachments. Frankly it looks a lot like my Dremmel."	"Good quality with many attachments."	"good"
"This supplement tastes AWFUL!! I have to drink it quickly and try to ignore how gross it is. The texture is pretty unfortunate also.  It definitely does, however, what it claims to do.

"With thick, straight, Asian (aka porous) hair, I often have to deal with frizzy hair woes.  Even though moisturizing helps, my hair still needed a little more help.  Motions Straight Finish Sealer helped quite a bit as it helped smooth down and moisturize my otherwise frizzy hair.  A small amount goes a long way - I put on a little amount in the morning, brush through my hair, and go on my way.  The sealer doesn't feel heavy, blends in easily, and makes my hair look great.  Recommended!"	"Great Hair Serum"	"good"
"Just didn't like the extra shipping which hiked the price up higher. I'm so used to Amazon's free shipping, and hate to have to pay for extra shipping. I don't think these are the largest size like I thought it would be from the descriptions, because in the package, the form that came along with it has larger sizes, more like what I would have preferred. I haven't tried them out yet, so we'll see. But I could have gotten them in the store for cheaper minus the delivery charge."	"These came fast."	"neutral"

"I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought this.  I was mainly just hoping for something that would help get rid of the dry, flaky skin that NOTHING else would get rid of.  The Neutrogena Wave did exactly what I was hoping it would do.  It got rid of my dry, flaky skin in only a few days time.  When my dry, flaky skin was gone, so was my need for moisturizer.  My skin is clearer now than it has been in more than ten years.  Even the redness in my skin is diminished.  It's a miracle product, it really is.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone considering it.  This is one purchase I will never regret making."	"ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!"	"good"
"In hindsight this is probably not the right kind of product for my short straight hair.  But what the hey, I tried it anyway thinking maybe it would cutdown on cowlicks.  I did apply this oil in the shower.  My hair did lay flatter but just a bit too greasy for my tastes so I will not add this to my regular hair products staple.  But too each his own - 3 stars for me."	"Probably Not the Right Product For Me"	"neutral"

"I have had this flat iron for months and never used it. I used it for the 1st time yesterday while my hair was damp and it did a great job on my hair.

"I have been coloring my own hair for over 20 years and have to say this product has given me one of the worst outcomes ever. I normally use L'Oreal Excellence or Preference in the brown and golden brown family, depending on my mood and the time of year. I have never had a problem with those products and directions. You do the roots first, wait for a period of time, then pull the color thru the ends for about 5 minutes and rinse. I decided to try the Mousse color because it had a shorter waiting period and seemed easier to apply. You just squeeze it into your hand and put it in your hair, grayest areas first, then do the ends. This mousse haircolor is easy to apply, but the color came out very uneven. It says it covers gray 100%, but that does not seem to be the case. I would say 70% is more accurate. I paid a lot of attention to my natural part and front hairline to ensure gray coverage. It didn't do such a good job. It has been one week and I need to use a touch-up kit. Also, the color seemed to grab in certain places on my hair leaving it a very, very dark, inky brown -- almost black. I cannot recommend this product and will not be using it again."	"Color is very uneven"	"bad"
"I've purchased a lot of flat iron from CHi ranging anywhere from $80 to $150 a flat iron. I also like Bablybliss. I've been using flat irons for about 10 years, and I have tried most brands on the market. Most flat irons do not do well on my hair when it is a no wash day, but I tried it, and it really worked. I tried it on a wash day and my hair stayed straight and smooth. Usually by the end of the day with humidity my hair starts to frizz, and it stayed pretty good. Plus it is fast. Many flat irons take several times over the hair to straighten my hair, but my hair was completely straight and smooth in one try.  I hope this flat iron lasts. It was a good price and it received high ratings and so far I give it 5 stars. It came in one day, and worked on smoothed and straightened my hair.  I recommend the HSI flat iron."

"Based on the reviews, I expected this to be a good concealer- I purchased the yellow corrector one for under eye circles. The yellow doesn't blend very well and it is sort of dry so it doesn't glide on easily. Compared to Cover Girl concealer sticks, this is an inferior product. The Cover Girl stick is much smoother and creamier."	"Doesn't apply very well"	"neutral"

"I really liked using this conditioner.  It has a pleasant smell and felt as though it rinsed cleanly from my hair leaving it shiny & healthier looking.  My wet hair was easy to comb through and didn't feel dry or greasy, just a nice balance.Unfortunately this blissful look was short lived.  Within a few hours, my hair looked dirty with a dulling color.  For a few hours my hair looked and felt great, unfortunately this was very short-lived."

"This is simply the best hand lotion I have ever used. I love that it isn't greasy, and I can actually see the difference in my hands when used a few times a week. The scent is not overpowering either. I have paid a lot more for a jar of hand lotion, but I have never had these results. I have a smaller size tube in my purse at all times, too. This makes a great gift, and I have converted a lot of new customers for this product. I highly recommend it."	"The best hand lotion I have ever used!"	"good"

"This is a nice, soft brush that is a great replacement for the powder puff I have been using to apply my mineral powder foundation for the last few years. I was tired of the weird streaky look I was getting with the puff, so I decided to try a brush. This brush is LARGE and the fact that it's retractable is a bonus- it's easy to carry along with you, travel with, and also stays cleaner when not in use. And it is a great applicator- the powder goes on smoothly and doesn't leave any powdery streaks on my face. Perfect!The only issue is that the brush came apart into four pieces (cap, base, brush, retracting mechanism) when I was trying to remove it from the packaging and now it doesn't retract anymore. If I futz with it a bit I can get it to slide back into the cap, but most of the time I just leave it out, which is fine but defeats the purpose of a retractable brush! Just be careful when pulling it from the cloth packaging it comes in."	"nice brush, but not well made..."	"good"
"I always like anything that helps create volume, but it is important for me that the product does not feel sticky, greasy and make my hair feel dirty. Unfortunately, this Toni&Guy powder did leave my hair feeling a bit dirty and without volume, despite that it does give a light hold. I personally would not buy it. Sorry. :-("	"Feels dirty in the hair"	"neutral"
"I read all the great reviews and bought this as a blind buy since I couldn't find it anywhere to test it.  I have to say, while it's not truly awful, I don't really like this.  It's super sweet and grape-y, and the berries smell kind of synthetic.  I would describe it as a sweet, gourmand and fruity scent, but it's dominated by the sugariness.  I don't particularly like super sweet scents - with a few exceptions - but this one gives me a bit of a headache.  I've worn it before, and it's definitely more of a night scent.  For better or for worse, it's quite heavy and strong.Also, the bottle is cute, but annoying; I don't like having my hand prickled and scratched each time I pick it up.  The cap doesn't actually 'cover' the sprayer, but it's more like a crown ring thing.On the 'bright' side, if you do like this scent, it stays on strong for a pretty long time."

"Nexxus Hydralight seemed a great solution for my fine hair that tends to get oily if I use heavy conditioners like Pantene or Dove. Several other conditioners don't work either. After using the Nexxus conditioner several times I am pleased with how well it absorbs and leaves hair feeling softer.Unfortunately, it does not prevent the frizz, if anything, it exacerbates it as my hair becomes frizzy and fly-away and I have to apply hair serums or sprays to smooth it down. On the positive side, it does not weigh hair down and my hair does not get oily and sticky like with other conditioners but it's impossible to live with the frizz. Makes it like a bad hair day every day unless I apply other hair products and style it.I still gave it 3 stars as it keeps the hair soft and non-greasy and works out well if I use a frizz control spray while styling my hair."	"Light conditioner absorbs well but makes my hair frizzy."	"neutral"
"Did not do what it said, despite following directions exactly, I noticed no visual difference whatsoever, maybe because i'm a man and men's skin is much thicker, that could be the reason but I still expected to notice something .

"Ever been tempted to buy some really compelling 'new' product 'as seen on TV?  I have.  With two exceptions (very cheap $10 ones) they were fairly worthless.  Some years ago, I was sorely tempted to get something, and knew its purchase would make a major dent in my budget.  I googled it, and found, of course, some pithy critiques. After that, I never made a buying decision without researching a bit. More recently, however, the companies themselves have managed to make use of those websites.  Now if you google 'hydroxacut reviews' you will find links that suggest they include negative and positive reviews, but you won't find a negative review.  You'll find instead rousing testimonials that rival those of the infomercials.  Even Consumer Reports can be bought.Amazon, on the other hand, features most everything offered anywhere else, on television or off.  Its customers give you the real 'skinny' on whether the product is worth its costs or not.  It's a bit confusing that this particular product is offered at so many price points, but I do like the reviews, and I find Amazon's customers much more credible than tv actors or voice-overs. Thanks to all of you for your many considered opinions.  You've saved me thousands over the years! Amazon is an impressive vendor, and its customers are even moreso."

"My hair is a dark strawberry blonde, or very light red, super fine slippery texture (usually soaks color right up). This shampoo leaves my hands and shower PINK, but deposits no color in my hair, despite using is as directed for a full 2 weeks.For a shampoo, it is fairly stripping, even on my fine sometimes oily hair.  For someone with normal or dry hair, this would be even worse.I tried the conditioner a year or so previous, and it does leave subtle but unevenly absorbed pinky magenta color in the hair, which for me, is not a good thing. I hoped the shampoo would be more subtle and less cheap looking on lighter colored hair.  If you have medium brown or darker hair, the conditioner in this series would work ok, but the shampoo will likely disappoint."	"Useless on my hair"	"bad"

"My wife tried this and here are her thoughts:\"I Do not recommend this product for fine, thin hair.The 7 day process of conditioning, in my opinion is too much,It made my hair \"too soft\" and less manageable to style, curl, etc.Maybe this treatment would be better for thick, layered hair or for hair that has been damaged.\"***Jim"	"Probably better for thicker, layered hair."

It is easy to squeeze out of the bottle, use a wash cloth or your hand to apply and work up a lather then rinse off. Make sure you rinse your shower floor when done, it can get slippery. Great product."	"Dove Body Wash with NutriumMoisture, Deep Moisture Nourishing, 24 Ounce"	"good"

"I have tried this top coat with Essie brand nail polishes and other brands as well, but this was disappointing since it didn't dry fast even with 1 layer of polish. I think the polish by itself would dry faster if I don't use this top coat. It does add a high gloss though which is why I am giving it 3 stars. I need to use my Sally Hansen insta dry drops with this top coat in order to make this dry faster. I would use up the bottle that I purchased, but wouldn't re-purchased. China Glaze makes much better top coats than this."	"Not fast drying"	"neutral"
"This is cheaply made, when I try to blend my foundation it leaves holes in the foundation because the sponge is not smooth so it would NOT give you that air brush finish. It took a long time to reach me, so disappointed don't be confused by the price it is not worth it."	"Waste of money"	"bad"
"I like to give my face a good exfoliation at least twice a week.  It leaves the skin feeling squeaky clean and soft after rinsing.  But I haven't found many exfoliating cleansers or microdermabrasion scrubs that really feel like they're doing much exfoliating.  This little 1.5 oz jar of aluminum oxide crystals solves my problem.  I just add a pinch of the very fine crystals to my facial cleanser and make my own scrub.The great thing about this is you control how much microdermabrasion your skin will receive by the amount of crystals you add.  And if you want to make an even more economical scrub, you can just use the crystals with regular soap, although I'd recommend a gentle facial soap like Dove or maybe Ivory.The jar is small but the crystals are mighty and a little goes a long way so I see the jar lasting me a good while.  One thing to be careful of, BTW, when using the crystals is NOT to get them in your eyes. Aluminum oxide is an irritant.  It's one thing to mildly irritate your skin, but another to irritate your poor eyes."	"Make your own microdermabrasion scrub."	"good"
"Even though I'm out of my teens, I still have problems with blemishes appearing so I'm willing to try anything to completely clear my skin. The Nature's Gate Organic Acne Treatment is a three step process of cleanser, toner and lotion. The box says for morning and night use and I've been using it everyday without a problem so it should be okay for twice a day, everyday use.I've been doing the three step process everyday for almost two weeks and I can't really see a difference in my skin. It doesn't really take care of blackheads and it has not stopped a new zit from forming on my forehead. The three step process is a bit tedious and if you do not have the patience to perform the regime, it can probably be easy to stop because you just don't feel like keeping up the process.On the plus side, it's great to find an organic product. Especially because it doesn't have any harsh or strong smells to it as some acne treatments can have. It also has cut down on my forehead getting too oily during the day which is a great thing.So even though it hasn't really made too much on my skin yet, I'm planning to keep using the product in hope that it can change my skin some. And even though it hasn't totally worked with me, doesn't mean that it can't work for some people."	"Can't see much of a difference"	"neutral"
"I have tried this on my own hair which is just past my shoulders, very fine, and even after using conditioner that gets rinsed out my hair still has a tendency to get tangled and I always use a leave in conditioner.  This didn't work well on my hair. It didn't help at all as far as getting through my wet hair with a wide tooth comb. It actually made the ends feel dry and at one point I had to check the bottle to see if I was using the leave in or if it was hairspray.  Don't get me wrong it's not sticky at all it just left my ends feeling dry and that was when my hair was still wet.  Even after I dried my hair it was definitely not a good hair day.  I tried it again but really just do not care for it. I also tried it on my daughter who also has fine hair, is only 6 yrs old, and hair down to her waist. I washed her hair and used a small amount of conditioner as usual and then tried this and it didn't help much with her tangles either. I've used others that I liked much better.  I would not purchase this again."	"Not enough for fine hair"	"bad"

Eucerin Intensive and Professional Repair have been so great for my eczema, but I thought I'd try this because it's specifically designed for eczema.  For me, it feels like any other lotion.

"Before reviewing this, I need to clarify that I am not writing about protection while sunbathing or swimming. I do neither and have no idea what that requires. what I am writing about is weedeating and mowing with it on, and walking through vast stretches of area with nothing but a shirt and a hat and this to keep the sun off.I've never been big for this type of stuff because it has some sides, normally. There's the stuff sticking to it and the mess it makes, not to mention the smell. and bugs; there always seem to be bugs. That noted, there is a heatwave this year and the temperatures where i live have been above 105 constantly. so, i picked it up and the smell was light, but the other problems were not that bad. and no bugs. That is a huge plus.This stuff rubs in well and it does a good job, letting me brown but not bake. Before, I had burned twice from being in the sun for less than an hour, but using this allowed me to stay out there for long periods of time. I think that really says it all. I used it for lawn work, exploring, helping with cattle, all kinds of odd jobs. and it kept going. good stuff."	"I'll be getting more"	"good"

"I'm 38 years old, have always taken great care of my skin and am no stranger to a good skin care regime but, despite all my efforts, fine (and not so fine) lines kept appearing and deepening and nothing I tried worked. A friend recommended that I try some kind of topical Vitamin C product, which was something I hadn't yet done. So I did a search on Amazon and up popped this product. I was very - and I mean VERY - skeptical but it had great reviews and a good price so I thought, &#34;What the hey? I'll give it a shot&#34;. I wasn't expecting to see results for at least a month after first using it (if at all) but, to my great surprise, I started noticing a significant reduction in the depth of the lines around my mouth and on my cheeks within a week. I was stunned. I've tried all kinds of moisturizers and serums (sera?) in my lifetime and this is the first one that lives up to its claims. I'm now a total convert and will not start my day without applying the Avizage serum. Their customer service is also excellent so I'd give it a six-star review if I could. I will recommend to all my friends! A customer for life!"	"My secret little weapon ...shhhhh"	"good"
"This is an ok product that I tried for summer.  I don't know why any sunscreen product has less than 30 SPF since 15 does almost nothing for you.  It does work as a thin moisturizer under heavier sunscreen for outdoor activities.  Again, it is super thin so be careful when squeezing the product out or you could have a disaster."	"Really thin -- should be packaged in a pump bottle"	"neutral"
"I actually thought I was really going to like the pink; it seems so cute and different and girly.  But as it turns out, I really prefer my dark brown brushes, because it turns out that with the pink, it's nearly impossible to tell how much blush I've put on the brush. I've ended up looking clownish because there was just too much pink blush on my brush when I put it on my face, but there was no way to tell because of the pink color of the brush.  At least with a brown blush you can see the pink on the bristles, so you have a sense of what you're about to put on your face.Other than that, the brush is fine for the price.  It's not super-soft but not offensively scratchy, either. Mine has not fallen apart like so many others have, so I can't complain about the construction.  Other than the pink color, it's a fine choice for an inexpensive makeup brush."	"I hate the pink"	"bad"
"I have curly hair which I wear straight.  I wash hair and put in big rollers while wet and let it air dry.  It dries nice and straight.  I use this hot air brush to sometimes briefly blow out some sections or more frequently after I've washed my face or showered and before the curls take over, I blow dry the damp parts.  I've been using hot air brushes for years mostly for the bangs and two side pieces.  Can't be without it."	"Perfect for me"	"good"

"Any product that claims to be be a 3 in one I'm leery of. Indeed, most shampoo and conditioner in one bottle I find to be inferior to a separate good shampoo and good conditioner. This product is no exception. It does have a nice fresh smell but there are better body washes, shampoos, and conditioners that are also, I think, more cost effective. I'll continue using separate body wash, facial soap, shampoo, and conditioner. Logic alone should tell most people it's unlikely a good facial soap would also be a good shampoo and/or conditioner.This product is for the guy who doesn't really want to bother with multiple products and doesn't care about having the best of any one particular type of grooming product."

"I didn't like this sunscreen very much.  I live in the Southwest and my skin (and my baby's skin) tend to be very dry.  When I apply this, it's very thick and hard to spread around.  It ends up streaky and powdery-looking.  Not the best I've tried!"	"Too thick, hard to apply"	"bad"

I always end up losing so much product because a cap came loose. For an item that isn't the cheapest (and with our thick hair we use a lot of product with each wash) it's a shame to have to lose so much :( We had ordered a total of 9 bottles of conditioner and 9 of shampoo and lost probably a total of 1 bottle."

"I got this to do a hot oil treatment for my hair. I was glad that this did not make a ton of noise as the old hair dryer I had scared my one cat. It works easy and wish that the bonnet was smaller. I had a problem with this falling down over my eyes. I like that this can be stored in the container it came in. The heat is perfect for me and felt good on a cold winters day. If you are looking for one of these then this one should be considered."	"great for doing an oil treatment"	"good"
"This color is kind of weird on my skin tone. Too orangey maybe? I ended up using it as a base for a french mani and putting a single layer of negligee over the finished nail to mellow it out a bit.

"I've had the clarisonic for about a month. I thought I would dislike it, but I don't--love it. I'm still uncomfortable about the high price of this beauty item (the retailer I purchased it from will accept returns after 30 days)and have been looking for a cheaper alternative. I thought I found it in the Pretika.Yesterday, I purchased the Pretika from TJMAXX (it was $29.99). I turned it on, right out of the box, and got excited because it seemed to have the same power as the clarisonic. I didn't use it though. I placed it on the charger for 24 hours per the directions. It gets 2 stars for easy set-up, ease of use and having the vibrating power of the clarisonic.Tonight, I used the Pretika for the first time about 10 min. ago and my face is still smarting from the experience. Like the clarisonic, the Pretika vibrates MINUS the rotation so it is very irritating to the skin. Your basically dragging a vibrating brush across your face for a minute. Ouch! I have oily acne prone skin and long-term use of the Pretika would just cause more inflammation. I will be returning this to TJMAXX tomorrow. I use the clarisonic once a day and it has never made my face feel like it was scrapped over with a vegetable peeler. I think I'm going to have to bite the bullet and just consider my expensive toy as an early Christmas gift to myself."	"Does not compare to clarisonic"	"bad"

"So I know this towel is pretty expensive in terms of bath towels, but believe me when I say it is SO worth it! Yes, people are correct when they say it \"clings\" to your skin, but the way to use it is to blot instead of vigorously rubbing the towel against your skin. This towel will leave your body and hair fuzz-free, AND for those of you ladies with frizz-prone hair, it is WAY better than a cotton towel. I have extremely frizzy hair, with flyaways, and this towel reduces the frizz dramatically! It also reduces drying time dramatically, which is great if you like to shower right before bed, so now you don't have to wait forever for your hair to dry (if you prefer air-drying like I do). The towel is durable and yet extremely soft."	"WORTH THE PRICE!"	"good"

"In hopes of saving a little money, I purchased this lotion instead of FOREVER AFTER ALL DAY MOISTURIZER 22 FL OZ AUSTRALIAN GOLD. Lesson learned. The reviews for the Playboy lotion were pretty good, but after using the product for several weeks now, I'm just not impressed. It doesn't seem to moisturize quite like the Australian Gold. I have to reapply regularly, which is  frustrating. Although several people bragged about the smell, I'm not a big fan. It's a little too much for me..too perfumey. In the future, I'll just spend the extra money to stick with a product I know I love."	"I'll Stick With Something Else"	"neutral"

"This Nivea shower gel regrettably left me unimpressed. Other than the generous size of the bottle, there is nothing that I particularly liked about it. I have dry and on occasion sensitive skin, and this shower gel exacerbated the condition. Immediately after drying off, the rough spots on my elbows, shins and hands were much more pronounced than before, and my skin felt uncomfortably dry and almost itchy. I had to generously apply calming and moisturizing body lotion to counter-act this. That the gel contains Blue-1 dye is a clear negative in my book - unnecessary at best, allergy-causing at worst and most likely the reason my skin acted up after using it.The advertised Frangipani scent is average and a dime a dozen. It does linger on the skin a bit and is not overpowering, so that's positive. But I will not use this again. 2.5 stars if that were possible."	"Not for sensitive, dry skin"	"neutral"

"This Replacement Brush Head looks like a Clarisonic Brush Head, but it doesn't act like one. I took it out of the box, inserted it into my Clarisonic, and turned it on. Buzz, Buzz, Buzz, no movement of the head, just a sound. I removed the replacement head and inserted the old head into the Clarisonic. It worked very well. No problem with the Clarisonic, only the replacement head.Lesson learned: trying to save money by purchasing a cheaper replacement head is foolhardy. The replacement does not work, money down the drain, and I will spend the money to buy a REAL Clarisonic Replacement Head.Not Recommended.  prisrob 10-22-12ADDENDUM:The seller reimbursed me fully for this product, plus shipping fee.

"I know there are some very long reviews about these. Here are my suggestions:1) watch the Youtube video and read other blogs/reviews on how to put them in. I had success my first time using and I think the extra research helped.2) I do feel pressure; it isn't true for me that you don't feel anything. I don't seem to have any extra cramping or discomfort other then feeling pressure in my lower, lower abdominal area though.3) I suggest taking these out in the shower if you can or follow the directions about using a medical glove so you have something to put it in to throw it away.I bought these mainly to use for intimacy during that time of the month and for that purpose these have worked great. I don't use these exclusively and still use tampons/pads as well. My partner has been thrilled with the results."	"Don't mind using these but switch it up with other products"	"neutral"
"Ok.I used a lot of shampoos but this one beats all records of useless ingredients for hair growth. Besides it makes everything that comes into contact with it super red. The skin becomes very irritated and you need to wash it off and wait half an hour until it calms down. So it is very clear the way it works. Menthol irritates the surface of your skin that makes the blood flow into you hair follicles and that stimulates the hair growth. That is as for the spray. As for the shampoo and conditioner. Mehhhh. Same story. Nothing special. I have no idea how this product got so many good reviews. Shampoo makes hair puffy and frizzy and spray irritates the skin. It goes into a trash bin.

"I've heard such great things about Proactiv so figured I would give it a try since my previous acne night cream has been discontinued.  Its a good product, it did help, but it did not totally keep blemishes at bay (it was the only thing changed in my regime that was working prior to the switch) and did not get my skin all that soft.  I found it to be middle of the road.Also, all the ingredients are not always listed in the listings so if they aren't here please note that this product contains chamomile in it.  If you have allergies like me, that's important to know.  I did notice a slight reddening in my skin that I'm guessing is from the chamomile since I am allergic to that plant."	"Not bad"	"neutral"

"So I followed the instruction and did what they said, but after like a week of using it I got up one day started brushing my hair and I had white stuff all in my hair. I was horrified to say the least. I went in started the tub and got in and used my regular shampoo and conditioner. I scrub the heck out of my hair and soaked it. When I got out it was all gone. All I can think of is it built up. I did like they said and made sure to rinse really well afterwards, but it still built up in my hair. Also the bottle is very small for the amount of product they want you to use in your hair. 10 pumps or more is just crazy after just that week of using it, it was pretty much all gone. I had medium length hair, not real thick. I was very excited to use it, but I don't think I'll buy it again."	"Built up not that great."	"bad"

"I bought this exact kit in BJ's wholesale for 15 dollars because they had it on sell and also had a 5 dollar off coupon. I decided to try it because Nexxus is a great brand and it's usually expensive. I have dry hair that breaks easily so it made sense to use this product. The issue to me is that the conditioner doesn't really hydrate your hair and the leave in treatment doesn't really smooth out my hair. I still get frizzies with it and my ends don't look any better.

The cream soaks in quickly and is not oily or sticky at all.I can not give it a higher rating because I did not find it to be effective at firming.  In fact it did not leave my skin as hydrated as other products I have used.  I will finish my jar, but will not repurchase.I am nearly 60 years old with fairly dry skin and I must need a need a more emollient product.  I think this one would work well for younger people."

"I don't like the smell of this conditioner. It's perfumey and teeters on the edge of being overpowering. Luckily, it fades as my hair dries, otherwise I wouldn't have been able to use it more than once. I don't find it to be particularly good for my hair, or bad. It just seems to be average. It made my hair easier to detangle than if I had used no conditioner at all, but I didn't find it to be any more effective than other brand of conditioners in this price category.This conditioner works as well as any to make my hair easy to detangle when it's wet, and manageable when it's dry, but the overpowering scent makes it a no go for me."

"I didn't get the great results from the Toni & Guy Plumping Whip that I'd hoped for. For my fine hair it weighed it down more than plumped it up. I think for thicker hair it probably works much  better because there is more hair to get better volume. My hair is shoulder length as well and I bet this would have better plumping power on longer locks than mine. I love the Toni & Guy conditioner however, which is why I would think my hair type isn't the best for this product. The Toni & Guy conditioners and shampoo I've tried have worked great so I was a little surprised when using this product that it didn't give my any added boosts because normally I get great results with their products."

This Pink truffle appealed most to me and at $6.79 I thought i deserved it. I'm really glad I bought it. When i tried it on in the car, it looked awesome. Lasts a good hour or two on me but that's no big deal. It literally takes about 5 seconds to reapply.Bottom line: I really liked this color. Feels great.

"I purchased several sets of these in a variety of sizes. I have two needs:1. Vanity top storage: protection from dust and grit.2. Travel: protection from smooshing.I think I will just go with a watercolor brush holder in the future. Brush & Tool Holder up to 15\".Might try on a couple of my watercolor brushes. Have not yet.I don't use to dry brushes after washing, with one exception. Larger brushes would take too long to dry and could develop mildew or otherwise damage ferule, glue, etc. Dry brushes on their side. If you have a way to hang them upside down (I don't) then you can do that. I like hanging them over the edge of the table if possible.Vanity top storagePRO:works well. I live in a desert with high winds and keeping surfaces clean is, well, impossible. Obviously the very tips will still get grit and dust, but there is less over-all exposure. CON: no  more pretty display of brushes and harder to tell which one to grab. 4 starsTravelPRO, most traveled well. 4 stars. MAJOR CON: But the ones I packed in a zip pocket, with space for a things to move around, allowed the cover to push back against the brush hairs and deform my expensive brushes. I had to wash and reshape them by hand and the hairs were very reluctant to be re-shaped. It may have broken the hairs. The ones in individual brush pockets in my make up bag did fine, but they would have anyway. THIS IS THE POINT OF THE PRODUCT AND IT DOES NOT MEET ITS PURPOSE. 1 star. (zero stars.)OtherBrushes will dry correctly when shaped by hand or even just tapped out. Once dry or nearly so, these performed very well on re-shaping a very old, large, fluffy, high capacity, high quality water color brush that I use to dust off any loose powder, blusher, shadow as a last step after a full make-up job. Not for blending. It is looking lovely, tho I am sure it will return to it's former state once used a few times. It was dry when I put it in and left it for two weeks. 4 stars for shaping up an old brush.  If it stays shaped up for six months, then it would be 5 stars, don't know yet.(I used to use my older brushes for travel and my newer ones for home, but now traveling alot and missed my brushes. That YouTube star, David Goss Makeup Artist, has ruined me on brushes! Now must have nothing but the best.)My recommendation is to get a watercolor brush carrier, the folding kind, like the Alvin Prestige Brush & Tool Holder  Brush & Tool Holder up to 15\". They pack flat, but don't store wet brushes in them, except for very short time (from studio to home).Based on my experience with watercolor brushes,  don't use a canvas or bamboo holder to roll brushes together against each other, but keep each one separate.Feel free to ask a question. Love to hear if they solved a problem for you. This stuff costs the company that packages them about a buck for miles of this tubing, which they cut, label, package and ship.

"I love Remington'sT-StudioandFastFinishblow dryers; they both surpass the inexpensive dryers I'd previously used all my life. This model, though, is just okay ... it's comparable to all those previous dryers.It's the standard professional shape (not collapsible), the standard 1875 watts, with airflow options of low and high, and heat options of cool, warm, and hot (plus a button for a burst of cold). An airflow concentrator attachment is enclosed and a diffuser is available (at no charge) through the company's website. (FYI: the nozzles of this model and the T-Studio are the same size and the attachments fit both; the nozzle of the FastFinish model is larger.) The box touts \"Keratin Therapy\" (a keratin-infused ring around the dryer nozzle) as giving \"healthier, stronger hair,\" but I doubt the claim and have noticed no such effect.The dryer's case is a beautiful pearlescent, light rose-tan color (not the gray shown in the product image above), and the switches are extremely easy-to-use toggles (rather than the hard-to-move sliders e.g. on the FastFinish). The airflow is strong and there's plenty of heat. But the case material is inexpensive plastic, the motor seems lightweight, and the unit is very noisy.My recommendations:For adults, try theT-Studio dryer-- it's visually beautiful, with strong airflow and plenty of heat while being the quietest dryer I've ever used.For use on children, try theFastFinish-- a fuller, blowsy airflow with very-warm (rather than hot-hot) temperature."

"I buy a body butter from a spa in Portland, OR - but it's incredibly expensive.  I thought I'd try this instead - but it didn't work out.  This product burned when applied, and my skin was completely dry again less than 20 minutes later.  I tried using it several times just to be sure I didn't like it - it certainly doesn't make my skin soft.  I'm sure for people who mildly dry skin it might be enough, but I have VERY dry skin and this did nothing to help that."	"So disappointed - not for really dry skin"	"bad"
"This Just for Me Hair Milk Shampoo has a nice fragrance, kind of generic, but nice. It also lathers very nicely to produce lots and lots of bubbles.  I know that the amount of lather doesn't really have anything to do with how well a shampoo is cleaning your hair, but I always feel like it's getting cleaner when there's lots. And it also means you don't have to use a whole bunch at a time.  I thought it did a nice job of moisturizing my hair which tends to be a little on the dry side.  I used it withJust For Me Hair Milk Conditioner, 13.5-Ounce Bottlewhich had a similar fragrance. It rinsed out easily but left a feeling like there was a little bit of moisture left behind.Aside from the shampoo itself, I like the packaging. The white color bottle is reminiscent of an old fashioned milk bottle. (They should have carried the theme to the lid.) It kind of gives the impression of simple and pure. The writing and name of the shampoo are a little confusing though. It sounds like a kid's shampoo but on the back it says to \"Keep out of the reach of children.\" Perhaps this means that you shouldn't let them drink it?"	"Nice fragrance, good lather"	"good"

So I thought \"the primer messed it up.\"  So the next time, I used nothing, and lo and behold, same mess.  It melted into every line under my eyes, and it was very hard to take off as well.  I had to break out the makeup remover and cotton balls to wipe this stuff off my face both times I've used it, and it did absolutely nothing to cover my under eye circles.

I guess I thought they would be flat rhinestones, but they are rounded.  the back of course is flat. I used tweezers to pick them up and put them on my nails (on wet nails).

It's been a couple days, and I have 2 kids and do a lot of washing of my hands and lots of dishes. my 2 year old also tried to pick them off, but they are still on there, i didn't have to use any nail bond glue, so I do like that.

"Let me describe what we're working with here.  I'm 49 1/2 with very fair skin.  Lucky for me, my propensity for buring kept me out of the sun and saved me from excessive sun spots later in life.  I didn't really start taking care of my skin until I was in my mid-thirties and I follow a very simple routine: wash, tone, moisturize, anti-wrinkle treatment and eye treatment twice a day.  I've tried lots of products both drug store and home based products (ie. Avon & Mary Kay) and I'm not afraid to try new products in the hope they will work better than what I'm currently using.  My major complaints are wrinkles on my forehead, between my eyes and around my lips and dark puffy circles under my eyes.  I suffer from severe chronic pain which means that instead of smiling I scowl which means that instead of having \"crow's feet\" I have \"smoker's lips\".  BASICALLY, I REALLY, REALLY HATE MY WRINKLES!!!  So, here goes nothing!When I first opened the jar, I was a little disappointed because this product was much thinner than my usual night time moisturizer.  What I learned was that thicker doesn't necessarily mean more moisturizing.  The Neutrogena had a nice fragrance (this is important to me-I once threw out a product that smelled like the industrial cleaner they used to disinfect the trainstation bathrooms), was light weight and absorbed quickly without any \"oily\" residue.  I continued my regular facial routine but substituted the Neutrogena Continuous Hydration Night Moisturizer for my regular night time moistuizer.  (I wanted to take before and after pictures but that didn't work out so you'll just have to trust me)  Anyway, after almost a month of use I can definately see improvement in the wrinkles across my forehead.  The wrinkles between my eyes were deeper and although I think they are a little less noticable it's hard to tell for sure.  The wrinkles around my lips, which I thought were very noticable, definately seem to be less pronounced.So far, I'm really pleased with the performance of this product and will continue to use it since it seems to be doing a much better job than my old night cream.  My husband even mentioned that \"we\" were getting a little low because apparently he had been using it too!  He confided he likes this product way better than my other moisturizer that he had been \"borrowing\"."	"I've found a new night cream!"	"good"
"I've used other clear scalp and hair products, and been very happy with them.  I do like the smell of this product, and if used very, very sparingly, it does the job on my hair and scalp.

Hopefully, the company will correct that because it seems to be an excellent product, just not for me."	"Warning, More For Ethnic Hair"	"neutral"

"I don't know how I was capable of guessing the correct color online, but I was lucky enough to do so. If you're not sure at all, I would recommend going to a store that sells wigs and checking out the correct color.With that said, I love these bangs. I have no experience with weaves, wigs, clip-in hair or whatever they sell at these stores. But I love getting bangs from time to time, but hate that after a couple of weeks, I'm sick of them and want my long bangs back. So I decided to try this out. I love it! I don't think the product is &#34;shiny&#34;. When I was reading reviews of this product I was very reluctant into getting them because so many people were saying it's shiny and looks too fake. I decided to give it a try anyways. I honestly love it! At first I was disappointed because I had no idea the clips would click open (like I said, no experience with this kind of stuff), and couldn't understand why the damn thing wouldn't stay on. After my brain decided to work correctly, I realized what was wrong and started wearing them. They look like clean hair. If that's what &#34;shiny&#34; means, then I guess they ARE shiny. It blended perfectly with my hair and I love being able to change my face from time to time. The only thing I'll say, is that the bangs are a bit long, at least on my face shape. I had to trim them a little bit, and I did it at home by myself. If you're not crafty, you can take to your usual hair place and I'm sure they'll do it for you.I totally recommend these bangs!

"This is my 4th hair straightener.  It's also my favorite and least favorite.Here are a list of pros and cons.  While the pros are great, Remington still has some work to do to make this a stellar product.PROS:*Lightweight - this is the lightest one I have used and I really appreciate that aspect of it.*Styles my hair the best.  Though I straighten my hair, I like to add a bit of flair to it with some flips at the end.  The smaller plates really allow me to do this.  Plus, that also allows me to get closer to my scalp.  My hair used to be straight as a child but has grown wavy over the years.  Getting the waves close to my scalp are much easier with this straightener.*Tourmaline offers ionic protection*Swivel cord really helps with less tanglesCONS:*The position of the on/off switch results in me inadvertently turning the straightener off several times for each session.  Annoying.*This is the biggest con - my hair gets pulled out by the seam in the plates.  While I have tons of hair, I am not willing to have several pieces ripped out every morning.  This is why I replaced straightener #2.Bottom line:  I am still looking for a light weight straightener with slim plates, a swivel cord, and those tourmaline plates that won't pull out my hair or get shut off constantly while I am trying to style my hair."

"For a lower price point shampoo, I would definitly give it two thumbs up.  I usually use Big Sexy Hair products, and find that they don't always leave my hair feeling both clean and moisturized.  I feel like with most shampoos you have to sacrifice one for the other.  However, this shampoo made my hair feel clean and hydrated.  The only thing I wish it had more of was scent.  I like when I can smell my hair all day, but with this shampoo, the smell didn't last long."	"Smooth"	"good"
"This body butter is a good, average-quality mositurizer that will do its job well enough. However, in the course of my experimenting with options, I've found this Yes To Carrots product to not be the best available, especially for the high price. I've used lots of other Yes To Carrots products and am generally pleased with them. This will produce healthy-feeling skin without too much of a scent, which is good - but I do have extremely dry and itchy skin in the wintertime, and this did not take care of all my itch. I also have a hard time getting it to rub into my skin all the way.If you're looking for a moisturizer that's still nutritional with plenty of vitamins, tryBath & Body Works Aquatanica Sea Moisture Gel Souffle with Exclusive Marine Nutrient Complex. Personally, the product after that link is the most incredible and unique moisterizer I've ever encountered; I can't recommend it enough. Another product that I think is of higher quality than Yes To Carrots's, and more worth the price, is pretty much any of Victoria's Secret's ultra softening body butters. However, with that brand you will be lacking in the organics.I hope this helped you in the search for something to nourish your skin in the healthiest way. Best of luck in the search."

"I honestly wanted this to work and really didn't want to give it a bad review either because we all don't have the same scalp; however, the honest truth is that it didn't work for me. I started it Sept.21 and it is today Nov. 12 and nothing has changed. I followed the instructions to a \"T\". I was using it on my edges and nothing happened. I contacted the buyer who is also the seller and she stated to give it time also if you have chemical damage this will not help. I want you to know that I do not have chemical damage but trichotillomania which isn't a chemical burn. I know hair can grow there because I have little spuds even before the oil. I've tried this oil on other parts of my scalp and it still doesn't work. I've been using an other oil and it looks promising. I know it'll take a long time before hair is restored around my edges. Unfortunately, this product only works on scalp with hair already. It needs to start off with a healthy scalp. FYI It's important that you remove the gunk and buildup on your scalp for any product to take place and help grow. I've done that and this product still didn't work."

"It works, it protects from getting sun burned. The sunscreen works no better or worse than any other sunscreen.In the package, I like the way this looks. There is a wavy pattern that looks kind of slick. Guess that is the sunscreen and the moisturizer layers. Once it comes out of the bottle, the lotion turns an ugly light green color. I transferred some of this to a clear squeeze bottle to take on carryon (the full size bottle is too big). That green color was not pleasant.The lotion is pretty much odorless. It rubs in easily. Once rubbed in it doesn't leave a greasy residue. I like the shape of the bottle, it is easy to squeeze and control how much lotion comes out.If it weren't for the nasty color, I'd love this sunscreen."	"Ugly Color"	"good"

"Very rarely in life do we come across cheap products that work better than the expensive ones. This one is frankly considered even lower than store brand but don't judge a book by it's cover-or go ahead more for me! This product works and doesn't harm you hair. If your hair gets dry, it's just holding the color and you will see that proof later when you wash and condition your hair. Any drier? No.Sheer Go Blonder has the same effect but using the Go Blonder is an event! If you have long hair this and have used this than you know what I mean. That little spray bottle and I have it out and are battling while the hour and a half of sweating and heat induced color spritzes my face. Yummy.This entails: No heat, no light, no smell, no wearing gloves, and having your boyfriend cringe when you are about to use it because he knows what the bathroom is going to look like, and most of all it's cheap! Half of you who even read this are not going to get this bottle to test it out either because it says, \"I was purchased at the dollar store and am just the kind of product that would do something girls cry over in the movies.\"That means more for me and my friends, perfect little gift to because these go away for a while. I bought 7 and might get some more to stock. Cheap long lasting products are priceless, but these are cheap.

"This is a nice hair dryer.  With 1875 watts and six speed settings it has almost everything you could want in a hair dryer.  The one thing it doesn't have that my other hair dryer has is a diffuser, a very handy attachment.  This hair dryer is comfortable to use although it weighs  pound more than my other hair dryer.  The cord on this hair dryer is 9 feet long, which I personally think is too long.  My other hair dryer has a 4 foot cord, which is sufficient.Although this is a good hair dryer, I would recommend the V.S. Dryer Pro with Finger Diffuser 1875 Watt by Vidal Sassoon which sells for only $16.89.  The V.S. Dryer Pro does not have ceramic radiant heat, which doesn't make any difference to me, but it does include a diffuser.

"A personal favorite in my collection since its debut in 2009, I use this perfume more than any other. It has a nice light, crisp scent. I love using it more in the Spring and Summer because of its kiwi and watermelon top notes and base notes of musk, and pink cyclamen. It comes across as a moderate citrusy / fruity scent. The musk is absolutely untraceable, as I do not like anything with a musky smell. I normally get a solid 6 hours of wear out of it. As long as this is in production, it will be in my rotation."

"I have been searching for a long-lasting, full coverage, lightweight foundation for a long time. I tried Amazonian Clay. It lasted all day and provided great, flawless coverage, but it was much too cakey and powdery for my liking. After returning the Amazonian Clay, I decided to swing by Macy's. I had a card for a free consultation and a 10 day supply of any foundation. So I felt like I had nothing to lose, so I took advantage of that. The girl who did the consultation told me my shade is Dusk (3C1) After applying this foundation, she asked me what I thought. I wasn't exactly sure how to respond. The girl did a great job applying it, I just wasn't crazy about how it looked on my face. Shortly after my consultation at Estee Lauder, I bought a bottle of Boots No 7 Double Wear Beautifully Matte. I've been using that for a little less than a week now, and I absolutely love it. I decided today to try the free sample of Double Wear.This makeup just isn't for me. Even though the girl who applied this for me told me it was full-coverage, I don't agree. I think the coverage is closer to medium than full. It also didn't give me a very flawless finish. It did an okay job of covering up the redness, but you can still clearly see the bumpiness underneith this makeup. I also don't like the way this makeup looks on my face. It doesn't look very natural in my opinion. You can definitely tell I am wearing makeup. I also have some very fine lines. So fine you can't even see them with the naked eye. But after applying this makeup you can see them clear as day. I'm also not sure this is the right shade for me. You can clearly see where the makeup has been applied to my skin. My skin is light/medium with cool undertones. My skin isn't fair, but it definitely on the light side. I think a shade or two lighter might have worked out better. I also agree with a previous reviewer who said this is like applying paint to your face. That is pretty much what it looks like when its dry.This foundation is too matte for my liking as well. It looks cakey and thick on your face.  But I also think that I'm allergic to something in this product. Ever since I applied it this morning, my face has been itching. It's enough to be distracting. I also found this makeup very difficult to remove. It took a lot of scrubbing.When I compare the two, there is simply no comparison between this and the Boots No 7 Beautifully Matte.  The Beautifully Matte foundation provides full, yet natural looking coverage, contains sunscreen, is oil free and hypoallergenic. It lasts until I take it off at night. It also gives my face a smooth, flawless finish. It covers both the bumps and the redness very well. Even better, the Beautifully Matte is much more affordable. It sells for $13.99 as opposed to a rather pricey $36.99 for the Double Wear. Who would have thought that I'd prefer a drugstore foundation over a high-end one? Certainly not me. But in my opinion, the Beautifully Matte is superior to the Double Wear. I will not be purchasing a full-sized bottle of the Double Wear. I'm glad I tried it out, but no thanks. I'll stick with my Boots No 7 Beautifully Matte foundation."	"Not for me"	"bad"

"I'm a total beauty junkie, I love trying new products and find it very soothing and luxurious to apply different potions and creams both in the morning and evening. I'm 32 with fair skin and an alarming dose of freckles(which I just like to call sun damage)though I do wear sunscreen now daily. I have a few fine lines and wouldn't mind those going away, but I don't so much mind the signs of aging(wisdom!).One thing I enjoy about this serum is the feel of it. It's silky and and a great dose of moisture. I was curious to see how the caviar extract affected my skin, and whether it would really lighten pigmentation. So far I have seen no noticeable changes besides my skin feeling nice after application. Some things I didn't like: it does have slight fragrance to it. It's not overpowering and I don't mind fragrance, but this one is a bit grandma scented, kind of floral. It could be attributed to the floral extracts present, but even still, I prefer citrus scents.I've been using this for over a month and while I do like applying it, so far I haven't seen any big results that would justify the price tag. I'll use it till it's gone, but won't be purchasing it."	"No noticeable changes"	"neutral"
"Another high expectations, and high disappointment. Yes, that`s great cream for 4 dollars, and if you have an oily skin, because it doesn`t really moisturize.

"Shampoos, like all cosmetics, are a highly personal choice. Unless it makes your hair fall out or makes you instantly look like a supermodel there simply is no justification in rating any shampoo as \"excellent\" or \"poor\". Despite the billions of dollars cosmetics companies spend on hype the actual product has one real purpose ... to clean your hair and leave it manageable.I used this product and when used without any additional conditioners it left my hair clean and soft. For that reason it deserves a review of \"I like it\" (4-stars).The major claim being made for this particular product is that it will leave your hair clean and frizz-resistant for 7 days. The marketing concept is similar to that of 5-day deodorant pads. Again, the choice whether someone wants to shampoo their hair only once a week or apply deodorant every 5 days is personal and up to them. But to be absolutely clear about how effective this shampoo would be given those circumstances it is important to carefully read Tresemme's statement of conditions \"Tresemme 7 Day Keratin Smooth Shampoo gently cleanses women's hair to help create smooth, frizz-resistant styles that last for up to 7 days when used with Tresemme 7 Day Keratin Smooth Conditioner and Tresemme 7 Day Keratin Smooth Heat Activated Treatment.\"  In simple words, no claims are made for the shampoo when it is not used in combination with the companion products.So, to be used properly be prepared to spend about $5 for a 9 oz tube of the shampoo (a reasonable price, by the way), $5 for a 9 oz tube of the conditioner, and a whopping $27 for two 3 oz tubes of the heat activated treatment. It would be reasonable to consider that price excessive to shampoo one's hair and rate the product accordingly as \"It's OK\" (which is 3-stars).One thing I would offer, not as a complaint (no stars deducted) but as a suggestion is that when I open the flip tip often some of the cream will shoot out, sometimes hitting the shower wall. I don't even have to be squeezing the tube for this to happen. My $1.50 ketchup container has a one-way valve that keeps the stuff from shooting out when the lid is open, wouldn't it be great if shampoo makers did the same?"

"The brush carries so much mascara on it that it is almost impossible to do more than one coat...and that coat sticks lashes together and clumps.

"I have to say this product is a decent product.  Probably worthy of at least giving it a try.  It left my hair softer with less tangles although it might add a tiny bit of weight to it, it isn't enough to dissuade me from buying the product.  What IS enough to make me not want to buy it is the packaging.  This jar was NOT thought through very well.  Sure it's different and chic but try opening a WIDE lid with little to no grip in the shower with wet hands. 40% of the time I have to grab a towel or washcloth to get a grip.  And once opened you are left with a huge jar in one hand and the lid balancing between fingers scooping out the product with the other hand.  The fact that I haven't dropped this during use is a miracle!!  Once open the cream is exposed to water getting in it.  It is just plain awkward to say the least.  Not to mention the jar seems to take up a lot of room on the narrow ledges or shelf inside my shower.  So until they make some sort of flip lid or smaller opening I think the effects this mask gives is not worth the risk of spilling it."	"Packaging is a huge turn off"	"neutral"
"I was not impressed with this product at all. I have thick, wavy, long hair, and it made my hair extremely FRIZZY and dry. I used it twice because I thought the first time I had done something wrong, yeah it was the product, my hair was unmanageable, I never have knots in my hair after taking a shower but I did after using this. My hair became extremely puffy (I looked like a chia pet), very frizzy and dry. I did not notice any difference with the shininess of my hair. I would not buy this product again nor would I recommend for anyone who has wavy, curly or thick hair in general.The product is not fragrance free, it is a pretty strong smell when it is first applied but after you wash it out it's not as strong, and it has a slimy consistency."

"I've owned this hair straightener for over 4 years now and still hasn't died on me. It does well straightening my hair, though it takes a few pass throughs to get the job done. After a year (if that)  of owning the thing, the dial that changes the heat broke. All it does is spin without changing the heat. The comb that attaches to the side slides out while using it, so it becomes a hassle. But for my long, wavy hair it does the job.

I also wore a hate every time I was out in the sun.  Maybe a good sunscreen for persons who are not outside a lot.  I thought it would give me more protection.

With my test sample, the stone detached from the glued pad while I was rubbing my foot on the stone. I wasn't even applying much pressure, as I had it sitting on a plush carpeted floor.The stone could be reglued, but the whole thing stinks so badly that even handling it with my hands left them smelling of chemical.

In practice, the conditioner comes out with some vaguely pink parts but I wouldn't call them stripes and nothing like the illustration on the tube.  It is a very thick conditioner and I have to work to distribute it through my hair (which is not very thick and barely shoulder length).The conditioner seems to work okay but my hair doesn't feel as soft as when I useSuave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Color Care Conditioner 28 oz.My biggest beef with the product is that the tube they use to try to get stripes does not appear to be recyclable.  I do not see a recycling code on it anywhere.  I try not to buy products in packaging that is not recyclable unless there is no other option.  Because there are plenty of color care conditioners available in recyclable bottles, I would not buy this product."	"Conditioner is OK but container isn't recyclable"	"neutral"

After 8 full months I expected some betterment or at least thickening.  This is a fail for me."	"8 month try"	"bad"
"I literally recommend this to all my friends! I have hair down to my low back area and of course the ends are split. I'm too attached to it to cut much off so I was excited to try the Nexxus. After the first 3 washes, I felt and saw a big difference. My hair had a nice shine and felt so soft. I'm now on my third set of shamp/cond. and plan to keep using it!"

"Well even though is not a bad primer completly it doesen't work for my oily skin at all , it doesnt help my foundation stay longer either but it does help to make my pores less visible and my fine lines and it does help to apply my foundation smoother . so if you dont hAve oily skin i think it will totally work for you"	"Good primer but not for oily skin"	"neutral"
"Arrived with a color broken. I was so mad..Anyhow i slept off my rage, cleaned it up the next day and am using the colors I have. I like the product, but Im not going through the trouble of shipping back when its not my fault. You may say one star is harsh, but those other 4 stars are my fee for having to carefully scrub the kit clean of residue when it was brand new. I hear thats a big prob when buying compressed powders and shadows is they rarely survive shipment totally in tact. You live n you learn"	"Yellow color broke when arrived"	"bad"
"I love this stuff. I initally bought my tube about 3 years ago. Although I dont wear it everyday, it has lasted a super long time and still packs some punch. I have recently replaced my tube & it is good as ever. You will definitely know that this little tube of fireworks is working when you swipe a thin layer over your lips with the tiny brush. If you are on the fence with this one, get it.Side benefit is putting it on and smooching an unsuspecting victim. The first time I did this, i forgot I had it on, and after I kissed my husband, he looked at me like I was crazy & said \"My lips are burning! What did you do?!?\" I just had to laugh, boys are such wimps sometimes."	"Tingled & Ready to Mingle"	"good"
"I have to start my review by talking about the way this product smells.  While it doesn't have added fragrance, it smells like... window cleaner?  That's the closest thing I can think of to describe this weird scent.  It's very off-putting and hard to get used to.  Even after being rinsed off, you can still smell it on your skin.The scrub itself is non-comedogenic, which is an absolute must for me.  However, the particles are very large and rough.  Why this is marketed to sensitive skin, I have no idea.  After using it, my skin felt someone dry. I ended up using it on my body instead of my face.I realize that's a lot of negatives, but overall I think it's average.  I wouldn't get excited about it or rush out to purchase it.  If you're looking for a fantastic facial scrub, try Dr Brandt Microdermabrasion 1.7 Fl Oz.  It's pricey, but worth it, and a little goes a long way."	"Smells Like Window Cleaner!"	"neutral"
"I was very disappointed in EUCERIN CALMING BODY WASH.  It comes out as an oil, which is nice.  It doesn't lather but turns opaque as you massage it into your skin.  I prefer more lather in a body wash, though I think it's more psychological than anything else.  (Even though it's not necessarily accurate, I think I need the lather to feel clean.)  I could have gotten past that, however (as the product does clean the skin), if the after-shower results were worth it.  I used the wash several times when I had time to wait for an hour or so before slathering on lotion.  Unfortunately, after washing with this product my skin actually feels drier and tighter than it does after washing with the oatmeal-based bar soap I was looking to replace.  Like I said, very disappointing!"	"Drier and tighter skin... not the result I was hoping for"	"bad"
"I absolutely adore this product.  It really does cover-up any redness or other discoloration around the eyes, though I do wonder if it would work as well on darker skin tones than mine which is pretty pale.  There's a mirror in the lid, so it's easy to make touch-ups.  It doesn't last quite a full workday, but it's better than anything else I've tried."	"a favorite"	"good"
"Good amount of shedding!!! Purchased these brushes because felt like I needed to upgrade my collection of brushes at the time...(\"I had them for years\")... These looked and sounded good on reviews so gave them a try. With first applications they were good,  but now it's been months and the shedding is quite a bit, when used they leave broken off little pieces of bristles on the face. I currently have invested in a better quality of make up brushes and have given these to my teenage daughter. The eye brushes from this kit are however pretty good for eye make up applications... Tip: wash before use!!!"	"Ok!"	"neutral"
"I started using Philosophy products with their set, called something like Makeup-Free Skin. This was in there, and I used it for a couple of years. It was my first jump up from drug store brands. I liked it well enough, but the lack of spf was kind of a bother, and I never really felt like it sunk in. In the summer, my skin can get kind of oily, so this may be part of it, but even right after washing my face it just wouldn't soak in, so I'd have to wait a while to put any makeup on. I was very conscious that I had moisturizer on my skin. Like I said, though, I used it for about two years, so I didn't think it was bad at the time. Since I've switched to other things, I can't imagine switching back to this."	"There's much better out there"	"bad"

"When I first got this product and the cleansing one (green colored) I was super excited to try it. For the green colored one I thought the scrublet worked better, but for this one I would rather use my hands.I'm not experiencing the same results with my blackheads as other people have noticed, but it takes the dirty and oil out of my pores. I also don't see as much exfoliation as it claims it does.I give it 3 stars still for cleansing out my face,the cute scrublet, and the low price, but I've seen better exfoliators out there."	"It's alright."	"neutral"
"I have straight, limp, very fine hair that is very prone to breakage. I never use heat on it besides maybe straightening it once a week, never put my hair up in ponytails, ect..... No idea what is causing the breakage.I was told to try a keratin shampoo & conditioner so I bought this and the conditioner that goes with it. I've went through both bottles and have notice no improvement in my hair breakage, in fact my hair is breaking off even more now, UGH.The shampoo and conditioner smell okay but smell like old people to me, and they lather nice and work good and leave my hair soft, but they don't work for the intended purpose so I'm not going to buy it again."	"Doesn't work for breakage"	"bad"
"After trying this lotion, I bought 3 more for me, one for my Mom, neighbor, sister-in-law and friends.  This stuff is great.  It smells wonderful and absorbs well.  I have used many lotions over the years - including the other bee lotion - but nothing even comes close to this.  Everyone I have given it to loves it.  I have tried several of the other Naked Bee products - they are ok - but this lotion is wonderful.  Make sure to get the Orange Blossom one."	"Love, love, love this lotion."	"good"

"I was re-stocking the guest bathroom and bedroom and got the bright idea to get a collection of Avalon, which I've always liked, so everything would match.The lavender scent is not pleasant and is not the lavender I am used to. In addition, the way the products are labeled it's almost impossible to tell which is lotion vs hand wash without a lot of light and glasses.The \"off-lavender\" odor of the lotion is very strong, almost overpowering, and the lotion itself is cloying and greasy.This was not a good choice at all - I should have looked more carefully at packaging and such before purchasing. But who can mess up lavender? Avalon. That's who.Can't recommend."	"Not good"	"bad"

"I started using Olay Total Effects 7 as soon as it came out.  I loved that I could use one product for basically everything - in my twenties, I didn&#8217;t need a separate night or eye cream as long as I used this.  It was available in several varieties, and I&#8217;ve tried most of them.  That it was available with SPF (15) or without was a plus, because sometimes the foundation I used didn&#8217;t have any. It was lightweight, never greasy, didn&#8217;t irritate my skin or cause breakouts, and it smelled great. I&#8217;ve tried many other products over the years but I always came back to Olay Total Effects 7.My lifestyle has changed significantly over the years, though.  I&#8217;m a lot more apt to do &#8220;outdoorsy&#8221; things than I was in my twenties.  So I was really excited to see Total Effects 7 with SPF 30. Unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed with the results.The texture is radically different.  This new Total Effects is a lot heavier than any of the other versions.  It&#8217;s noticeable from the first pump.  It feels completely different going on.  It felt more like a thick, drug store brand sunscreen than it did a moisturizer.  Fifteen minutes after application, my skin was really shiny and greasy, as if the product didn&#8217;t absorb.  I have really oily skin to begin with, so this was a huge turn off.  I also noticed some tiny bumps on my skin after a couple of days of use.I still love Olay products, and I&#8217;ve learned by now (I hope) to stick with them.  But I think next time I&#8217;ll get the old SPF 15 version and just make sure I use other sun protection measures."	"I prefer the SPF 15 version"	"neutral"
"I really wanted to like this color. I bought it to use with my UV light for when I do a french manicure. It has a very subtle sparkle to it, but it's verrrrry light. I also found that after about 2 days of wearing it, it got a dingy, yellow-ish tone to it. I was looking for a natural pink that I've gotten at the salons during a pink and white manicure, and this did not meet the mark. I've also tried it solo, but it takes about 3 coats before you can even see it on my skin tone. Unfortunately, this one won't get a lot of use from me."	"Dingy pink"	"bad"
"So before purchasing Caribbean Hair Grow, I read the reviews.  I'm not a vitamin junkie.  BUT, there was a consistency in the reviews indicating satisfaction with the product. Could it be that all of those reviewers weren't telling the truth? Or that they were posers to boost sales? Well, I didn't know but decided to take a chance anyway.  Lo and behold the vitamins were out of stock! I checked all over and could not find them. I figured it must have been a manufacturing issue as to why they could not be found. A few weeks later, I received an alert from Amazon that the vitamins were in stock and pounced on the opportunity to order, right away!I purchased two bottles and have been taking the vitamins for 3 weeks.  Let's just say...so far, so good!  I have seen visible growth on my hair-line.  Fine hairs have appeared out of no where.  I guess it could be that all of those people who gave glowing reviews were telling the truth :)  I will continue with the vitamins until they are all gone. Something tells me I will be ordering more."	"So far, so good"	"good"
"It's good for the most part, but it's kinda sticky and makes my hair kinda *solidified* when it dries up. The smell is good. Wish it wasn't in a spray bottle so it'd be easier to apply to the hair."	"Sticky!"	"neutral"
"I just started using Gratiae lifting serum after buying it from Amazon and thought it was a decent product at first but the consistency reminded me of something else I'd used but couldn't put my finger on it. Then I read many Amazon reviews by customers who said they'd first learned of the product via high pressure kiosk sales (never a good sign). I also looked at Gratiae's website and pricing which includes a warning not to buy their products elsewhere as \"fakes\" could damage your skin. I also noted that there are virtually no reviews by reputable beauty reviewers such as Allure magazine editors. And THEN I looked at the ingredient list.The first two ingredients are basically dimethicone and another silicon common in hair smoothing products. THAT'S why it felt familiar.  I've used that on my hair.Let me say FIRST: These ingredients are NOT TOXIC and have been approved by the U.S. FDA (a governmental agency) for use in beauty products. There is no truth to the fact that the U.S. govt says these ingredients are toxic. HOWEVER I think you'll find most skin care people do not recommend them. They are basically plastics. They don't allow your skin to breathe and instead layer it with a thin layer of plastic that will dry out your skin and in my opinion also prevent any good ingredients from being absorbed into your skin.The product is OK as a makeup primer in the daytime. I might even say it's \"good\" as a makeup primer except for the fact that it is preventing your skin from breathing. Any benefit you get immediately is great, but don't expect any long-term benefits. I wouldn't be surprised if the company itself supplies Amazon with the product to sell for a low price since it can't be moving at $400 per product.These days most hairdressers advise clients not to use dimethicone because it dries out your hair (from not breathing). And you can't use it with extensions because it dissolves the bonds. I've had to look for alternatives to dimethicone (or any of the \"icone\" products) and all the hair products that don't have it are much more expensive. Because silicon and plastic is CHEAP.This stuff won't harm you if you buy a single bottle or just use it ocasionally as a makeup primer as that's what they all are made of, but it's a temporary fix. A layer of plastic on your face may even protect skin from the elements or smog temporarily. But it won't provide any long term benefits & isn't good for continuous use.  If you want to use it during the day, whatever you do, DON'T put this product on your face at night when your skin needs to breathe to regenerate itself. It will not help and will prevent your skin from the healing that happens when we sleep. There are a couple hyaluronic acid and Vitamin C serums Amazon sells that actually do lift and reverse aging that do work, including Ultimate Swiss Hyaluronic Acid & Vitamin C Serum and Oz Naturals. Both of those ingredients  actually do lift the skin, even skin town and reduce fine lines and are effective anti-aging products. The Ultimate Swiss has a more watery texture and soaks in and contours and lifts. Oz Naturals has a more creamy feel like this product but without silicon. At first I was frustrated with Ultimate Swiss's small bottle (which is $13 on Amazon rather than $85) but it actually does last 3 weeks if you just use what is needed  (I sometimes like to slather it on.) (Oz Naturals has a larger bottle for $25 and I like that product too.). But the bottom line is, hyaluronic acid is something that exists naturally in our skin and is what gives our skin elasticity and as we age our skin has less of it. Researchers for skin care companies discovered this and found that hyaluronic acid does work both as a filler injected by dermatologists and also when applied topically. HA is great for lines and lifting and vitamin C is great for skin texture and tone. Combining these two is smart and a great combination. The serums I mentioned on Amazon have those two ingredients at the best possible price and it is only my skin care product addiction that caused me to buy the Gratiae serum just to see.The more I look at the ingredients and the more I read the ridiculous claims on the company website the more I am convinced that this stuff is a sham, I believe someone decided they could substitute dimethicone (cheap) for hyaluronic acid which is the real thing. Other ingredients like jojoba oil and a trace amount of retinol are fine but I doubt they can even penetrate the skin when they are used with dimethicone. All the listed ingredients are cheap and absolutely nothing in it justifies the outrageous prices on the Gratiae website. I believe Gratiae's plan all along was to have a website with super expensive prices that make it seem like the product is high grade and high quality while then making most of their sales at prices like Amazon charges so you keep buying it because you think you are getting a deal. What high quality product is sold in Las Vegas at kiosks with super high pressure sales people? The only ultra expensive skin care product I have purchased and would buy if I could afford it is Creme de la Mer. And they don't need to shove their product down your throat. It sells itself. High pressure sales and ingredients like dimethicone are highly suspect  and not the way a reputable company does business. Just my opinion  I won't buy it again that's for sure.  I took the time to write this review because I suspected fraud and sleazy business tactics and could not let that stand."	"Not Great For Skin But Not TOXIC: OK As A Makeup Primer"	"bad"
"I really liked how easy this product was to put on and how light weight it felt on my skin. It really didn't leave any kind of residue, at all. I've only been using this product for a little more than a week, but I can already feel and see a difference. My face feels smoother, brighter and even a little firmer. I have really sensitive skin and is prone to breakouts, so I am always a little hesitant to try new things... but, I am happy to say that it had no negative effects on my skin. It also seem to reduce my pore size, fine lines and it has definitely evened out my skin tone! Overall, I am pretty pleased with this product and would definitely recommend it."	"Great product!!"

"If you were looking for a wig that looked exactly like the one on the picture, you will be disappointed. This wig is not worth it. After wearing it the first time, the hair tangled so much that I had to chop the bottom part of the wig off to control the mess. Not only does it tangle really easily, it also sheds like crazy, this is no joke the shedding is beyond explanation, at this speed there won't be any hair left and the wig is already thin to begin with. It looks nothing like on the picture, it's super thin and the fringe looks nothing like on the picture. I'm beginning to think that the model's wig on the picture is her real hair and that the wig is a very bad imitation of her real hair. Save your money, don't bother."

"I picked up a $5 stamping kit at a local grocery store and I was having a really hard time with it. I watched endless videos on Youtube on stamping. When I received this one yesterday I was really surprised how easy it was. I used it with the white Konad nail polish - but also tried it on some paper with other brand nail polishes and it seemed to work great as well. I did not use the scraper cause of the reviews and instead used an old gift card. Some tips: Don't press to hard - I noticed if I press the stamp to hard onto the plate the image transfers crooked from the pressure. - Always check the stamp before stamping it onto your nail to make sure the whole image has transferred. And always clean the stamp, image plate, and scraper after each use with Acetone nail polish remover (I use a Q-tip dipped in acetone. I did butterfly's (uploaded an image) and I used the small side of the stamp! It worked perfectly. I am recommending this to all my friends! PLEASE: If you have problems watch videos on Youtube. There are some great ones out there that will help you to master the technique with a little practice. I am not a nail tech. I could not find anyone to do nice designs after we moved at the nail places in my area. I never did nails before like this. This was my FIRST time with Konard and if I can do it.... YOU can do it too!!! :D"	"This works PERFECTLY!"	"good"
"I first purchased this thinking it was going to be a dark grayish brown? Sounds odd, but it looks like a nice subtle dark polish in the picture.

Its a nice color but I wouldn't reccommend it to anyone with a dark skin tone."	"Odd color, but I like it."	"neutral"

"At first, I thought this was working. It does thicken my fine, thin hair, but not any more so than my Salon Grafix Conditioning Cleansing for Oily or fine hair, which is my absolute favorite, but hard to come by in local stores. After a while, I started to notice how dry the mid to end of my hair was, and it was all because of this product and the conditioner within the same line. I have greasy hair on my crown, but have always had normal hair elsewhere, but this dried it out so bad, without doing anything for my grease at the same time. I completely cut this out of my hair routine, and just started using the salon grafix one once more, and now my hair is back to normal. I thought this shampoo would work well because it's sulfate free, but I was wrong."	"Dried out my ends"	"bad"

And does give full coverage, but I find it almost a little cakey. I can't comment on the longevity of this product because I couldn't stand it to wear it for hours.I think a good description would be like putting on badly flavored icing on my lips.I have the color San Paulo which is a good color. So I use a little bit of product and rub it to give my lips some color. This is the only way I find the product works for me."	"I was disappointed in this product"	"neutral"
"The AXE Waterless Foam Shampoo made my hair greasy when I used it. That result is totally the opposite of what a dry shampoo is supposed to do. As I first dispensed the product in my hand, it seemed to be better than other dry shampoos because it didn't have that offensive odor and powdery texture that most do. I've never been a real dry shampoo fan because of those attributes. The AXE Waterless Foam Shampoo has quite a pleasant scent to it and a foam texture of course and not that powdery texture but when I applied it, it left my hair greasy looking so it defeated its purpose.I can't really recommend this."

"I have been a longtime user of Clinique's Dramatically Different lotion. It's expensive but everyone always told me it was the best. I have had occasional skin irritation, and my face was usually fairly oily at the end of the day but I just assumed that was normal. I was wrong.I received a trial of this product last week and started using it right away as I was almost out of my old stuff. At first I was a little turned off. My skin felt a little greasy after applying the Dove product. Within 5 minutes though the greasy feeling was gone. Moreover, even 24 hours later my skin felt smooth, not at all greasy and 'tight' in a good way. I have been using this daily since then and note the following:1 - like I said, when I put the product on it feels a little greasy but that is gone in 5 minutes2 - somehow or another my skin does not feel greasy even 24 hours later3 - My skin is moisturized without feeling moisturized - it is hard to describe the feeling but I like it - a LOT4 - My skin irritation is gone. No redness around the nose, no blemishes. It's 100% better.5 - No annoying smell at all6 - With my old product I would get an occasional pimple.

I am glad this happened because as i emptied them all out to re-organize them i realized i was missing A LOT of pieces!

I have tried just patting it on my finger and almost scooping it out of the container and I still never get much product out.  Once I finally got enought on my finger to be able to blend it on my cheeks, it almost looked too fake and bright to even wear out of the house.  The only time I wear this is when I feel like being bright and noticeable since the colors are so bright.I have come across some that are too faint to even see on the skin and others that are very bold and flashy and do not look natural not matter how small of an amount you put on.

"The tape looks pretty, but it tends to pop up on the end of the nail. The only thing is, I think it's more because I have no idea what the heck I'm doing, and also have never given manicures before. So I wouldn't hold it against the people at World Pride. I just need someone to show me what to do. LOLOLOLI think nail people do this a lot. It made me tired and it was too hard.

"THESE ARE NATURAL HAIR BRUSHES made from goat and badger fur. If you assume you are buying a cruelty free product because they tout that they are a member of PETA on their description, you are incorrect. It's not like they go out an clip the fur off a live animal to make these, they are made from fur scraped off of hides before they are tanned for leather. Sure, you can say that using 'spare parts' makes you cruelty free, but let's be serious.Quality is lacking as well. These are a nice set of brushes if you are first starting out on your make-up journey, but they wear quickly. I wash my brushes once a week with warm water and Sephora brush shampoo and one of the large eye shadow brushes fell apart within only a few washes. Also, there are 17 brushes pictured in the online image, but you only get 12 seemingly random brushes. I did not get an eyebrow brush, one of those foam brushes pictured, the thin brush, and the standard sized brush.If you take make-up even a little bit seriously or if you have high end make-up that you want to apply correctly, please go buy quality brushes. If you are on a budget, the gift sets from Sonia Kashuk at Target are perfect and all under $25."	"These are sub-par"	"bad"

First, I have dry skin and it didn't do a thing for that., secondly the scent of this stuff is so overpowering it is giving me a headache - and I only used it on a small area of one forearm! So there is no way I can use it on arms legs and face out into the sun for further testing...I could not take the smell."	"Hate the Scent"	"neutral"

"I've got somewhat thick, curly Caucasian hair -- and I am always on the lookout for hair products to keep the frizz and flyways in check.  I thought this was so-so.  Honestly, I prefer conditioner that is a little little thicker, richer, heavier than this.  I don't think it has the conditioning power of a hot oil treatment, for example.  It certainly didn't leave my hair greasy, but it didn't really keep it as controlled as I would have liked.  After using it as a rinse-out conditioner a couple times, I tried rubbing a bit of the conditioner into my dry hair before styling -- I thought it was more effective that way, and it preserved the wonderful, baby powder scent.This was okay, but I doubt I will use again, as I don't think it's heavy-duty enough for my thick hair."

"I've been trying to find a mascara that gives my eyelashes more volume/fuller and was greatly disappointed by this product. When you put it on, it comes out very thick and clumpy.

"I have been using this product along with the matching conditioner for the last several weeks.  My hair is naturally curly, and does tend to frizz.  With all of the thunder and lightening storms we have had over the last few weeks, I have had an excellent chance to test out this conditioner vs the mother nature induced frizz.I personally tend to swap between Herbal Essences and Pantene about every other bottle, so I am no stranger to Pantene products.What I have noticed about this shampoo/ conditioner:1) The shampoo is runnier then the normal Pantene, so when you first use it, be careful because it's easy to run it over your hand and waste some of it.2) The scent is nice, though nowhere near as potent or long lasting as the original Pantene products.3) My hair did stay more \"calm\" although this could be because of the buildup that Pantene is known for.4) I didn't find that my hair was any smoother to the touch then when using the Herbal Essenses or other Pantene.  In fact it actually FELT a little rougher then after using the other Pantene products.In conclusion - I'm not sure that I would spend extra money on this line of products, but I certainly didn't find anything wrong with them.  I would have a hard time buying Pantene products and not having that smell that I so love.  Still if this is your hair type and you have frizz issues, you might at least want to give this a try.  It's no miracle but it can help a bit."	"Runnier than normal Pantene"	"good"

"Right out of the bottle I loved the sweet, mild flower notes and just enough 'lily' to not make me sneeze, I'm very attracted to florals.

(But really you shouldn't have to bathe in it; Joy and Stella McCartney are one-spray long-lasting!) I asked coworkers if they liked my perfume and no one could really smell anything, \"Oh is that your shampoo? I think I kind of smell something perfumey\".I purchased the deluxe sample size bottle so it lasted two weeks; no one complimented me or commented on my fragrance. Frankly once I left the house and had been at work about an hour, I didn't smell it either. I couldn't really smell anything on my clothes at night when taking them off. It's like this perfume was there to enjoy for a little while and then it just disappeared.Disappointing, as it is a pretty scent when it IS there."

"I've had this mascara for a long time, and when it runs out, I'd probably buy it again. It instantly makes my lashes look longer and I've never had a single problem with clumping. It lasts all day as well. My only problems are that it doesn't make my lashes look any fuller, which is what you'd expect from a mascara named &#34;Voluminous&#34;, and at the end of the day I sometimes see black smudges under my eyes. But that's after 12+ hours of wear, so not that big of a deal. Overall I think this is an excellent mascara."	"great"	"good"

"Love love love love love love love love Argan Oil!!This truly makes a difference in my hair. You only need to use a drop or two for your whole hair. I have longer hair so I usually use 3 drops after I shower. I unfortunately have to dye my hair at least once a month due to grey hair. So, needless to say my hair has taken a beating and definitely needs TLC. Very dried out and damaged hair as you can probably imagine. But using this even one time I noticed the difference.My hair is silky smooth and has never been softer! I find myself twirling my hair constantly.It also makes your hair look great. Other people compliment how healthy my hair looks very frequently.My hair dresser even asked what I was using!I love this specific brand the most out of all the Argan Oils for these reasons:**The results are incomparable!**The packaging this comes in is a great design. The bottle is capped and comes with a pump to install when you are ready to use it.-(Most other products use droppers and are not nearly as precise, while with the pump you know each pump is the same amount)**Silky smooth hair that is healthy looking!**Fast delivery!! Received it within 2 days!**Great customer service! I had a few questions on the product before I purchased this and the seller was very informative and helpful!**You get tips on how to use this product other ways for you hair, nails and skin!!I gave my mom one of these to try as well and she loves it!

"I've been on a hunt for a new facial moisturizer for the last several months, as my favorite moisturizer has been discontinued. I decided to try Neutrogena Naturals Multivitamin Nourishing Moisturizer because it has good ratings on Amazon and because I've previously used other Neutrogena products and been happy with them. Unfortunately, I was not happy with this moisturizer at all.A rundown on my skin type. I have very sensitive skin. I tend to have combination skin, although when my skin is dry it is VERY dry. It it gets oily it just gets moderately oily. I don't really have issues with breakouts (only a pimple here or there from time to time), but do have issues with my skin breaking out into a itching rash.When I purchased this moisturizer I was hoping for a light-weight, oil-free, scent-free moisturizer. I wanted something that didn't leave my skin feeling oily, but also moisturized it. Also, having very sensitive skin I need a moisturizer that won't cause pimple breakouts or rash breakouts. Lastly, I need a moisturizer that I can put my liquid foundation over and still gives me an even skin tone. Sadly, the Neutrogena Naturals Multivitamin Nourishing Moisturizer didn't measure up in really any of this areas.Product Pros:- It moisturizes your skin.- Is for the most part scent free. It is not per-fumy.- Didn't breakout into a itchy rash.Product Cons:- It is NOT lightweight. This is the thickest facial moisturizer I have EVER purchased.- It left my skin feeling VERY oily and it felt as though the moisturizer was just sitting on my skin.- I has more pimple breakouts with this product than what is typical for me.- It left my skin uneven, especially when I applied makeup. I think this is in part to its thickness and lack of soaking into my skin.This moisturizer says it is breathable and leaves your skin feeling clean. This was NOT even remotely the case for me. In fact, the consistency of this product is so heavy I think it is much better suited as a body lotion than a facial moisturizer. In order to avoid completely wasting this product, I ended up putting it on my legs and using it as a body lotion. It worked perfect for that.I wouldn't recommend this product and will not be purchasing it again. However, I do have to say that the one thing I've learned having life long issues with sensitive skin is what doesn't work for one person could work fabulous for another and visa versa. So sadly, unless everyone is saying its horrible, you might have to try it out for yourself to find out it if is the right product for you. Everyone's skin is different and reacts differently to products."	"Better Body Lotion Than Face Moisturizer"	"bad"

But everything else is about the same.The idea of using any waxing system with a roll-on top is just plain ludicrous.

I should also mention that after the harsh redness faded (took a solid week) I actually really like the color and might do it again!"	"redder than hoped for, but good gray covererage"	"good"
"Took a bit to come though delivery I got  this Moroccan Argan Oil and I  heard a great deal of stuff about Spain wonderful things about not only the product, but this company as well. To start, the item was shipped quickly but was suppose to take longer for delivery but came a way lot sooner and packed great inside of a box and also sealed so it would not leak. So far, I have used this product as a daily moisturizer on my face + body and nightly on the ends of my hair. My hair is soft and manageable when usually it is dry & brittle and I tried a little in my tub bath to moisturize My skin which is combination between dry & oily it is now almost flawless so I have seen a significant improvement in both only after using a few times! I was skeptical at first, but my results are undeniable. This product has worked its way into my daily beauty regime. It don't matter it came from Spain courtesy of den of goods ."

"I bought this dye, Vidal Sassoon dye in medium chocolate brown, to cover my grays.  My hair is already a very dark brown and I had whitish shiny streaks of gray in it here and there so I wanted to cover it up.  It's a medium brown so it's not as dark as I'd like it to be but it did cover the grays, turned the grays a light brown instead of white like I had before, rest of my hair is dark but I can see some light brown at the crown of my head.  Once you mix the dye in the bottle it turns orange-it's supposed to look like this so don't let it freak you out, your hair won't turn orange, when it dries it turns the correct brown color.  It wasn't very stinky but it did smell like chemicals but nothing horrible, however it was potent enough to make my eyes burn and tear a bit and I had the window open in my bathroom all the way.  Left it on for 30 min.  Rinsed.  Even though I rinsed it pretty good when I squeezed the water out of my hair the water still came out brown, even after rinsing seemed to run clear water.  So I went and rinsed it out in the shower and used a small amount of shampoo and then the conditioner it comes with.  The conditioner they provide is a long red tube which has enough conditioner in it to last a couple more shampoos, they give you alot.  I didn't see anything impressive about the outcome from the conditioner but the color does adhere to the grays making them a shade lighter than the rest of my hair.  The color also may be a shade lighter because I did a quick shampoo afterwards but it didn't wash the color out of my hair or strip the color, I used a tiny amount of shampoo, less than I usually use.  It does feel soft  however.  Afterwards I let my hair air dry (no hair dryer), then used Got 2 be flat iron balm/spray on my hair and then flat ironed my hair straight-no color came off on the flat iron at all. Before flat ironing my hair it did look a bit frizzy but it was very humid here today so not sure if that was from the dye or conditioner or the weather, the flat iron took care of the frizzies and in combination with the flat iron  balm made it smooth and shiny.  Personally I feel the color adhered quite well, last time I used a foam dye and it was patchy, I'm finding this creme dye covered much more evenly.  Can't see my grays anymore, grays are now a light brown and the rest of my hair is dark but this is only really noticable in direct sunlight, inside the house it looks all brown.  I like it but next time I'd go just a shade darker, just my personal preference but as for color coverage it works quite well. So......PROS:Even color coverageCovers gray hair strandsEasy to use, not very messyDye is extremely easy to wash off of skin with just water, comes right off even after drying on skinTakes only 30 quick minutesDoes not smell very much while waiting 30 minutesProvides lots of conditioner, enough to last numerous showers and shampoos (and the conditioner smells really good)I used regular shampoo on it within 20 min afterwards (was not a color treated safe shampoo) and the color held and didn't wash out at all.  I used Suave Keratin shampoo.Dye did not come off on my flat iron within hours of dying it.  Even at almost 400 degrees.CONS:Slight odor when applying color, can make your eyes burn without direct contact, even when there's ventilation.  Be sure to use this product quickly and you can avoid this.  My eyes only started burning when I was almost done.Dye turns orange in bottle, may put some people off and confuse some into thinking they got the wrong color or their hair may turn orange! (this is normal, it's supposed to look orange)Color on  box may vary with your results, though almost all hair dye is like this.TIPS:If you want to flat iron your hair after using this be sure to use a flat iron spray or balm, it not only protects your hair from heat but also seems to protect the color as well.  If your hair is frizzy after a dye job, and you want straight hair, use a flat iron.  I have a Remington Shine flat iron infused with avocado, completely smoothes out dry or frizzy hair and makes it shiny.To shine up your color treated hair purchase anything called \"shine spray\", self explanatory, use this after flat ironing.If you want to dry your hair with a hair dryer make sure to put flat iron balm or spray on it first, same concept as a flat iron, protects your hair from the heat.  AFter blow drying it spray either some water or a cool conditioner spray on your hair-you have to cool down your hair after being under such heat, keeps it from getting frizzy or looking dry.All in all I'd buy this dye again but in a darker color, much better than a foam dye and sticks to the hair pretty good."

"I think the shampoo and the condition smell good. I really liked the conditioner, and although it's really watery, it was great at getting any tangles out. It did leave my hair feeling dry and seriously took away any body, leaving my hair limp and flat. I used it for two months and have finally switched to something else as I couldn't take the limp hair any longer. I'm not sure if it ever helped with hair growth.

I thought perhaps I used too much the first time, and used less the second time, and holding it further from my hair. I still got the same icky feeling in my hair!I wasn't really impressed.

"Before I started really reading the labels on hair products, I really liked this product; however, the shampoo contains- Sodium Hydroxide (it's caustic, and is found in chemical relaxers, which are used to permanently straighten the hair, and can even dissolve the hair), and protein (which can cause even more frizz if it's used often)."	"Read the ingredients on this before buying it!!"	"bad"
"Pros:AffordableGets hotter than most other non-professional grade flat ironsSmooth ceramic platesCute designAutomatic shut offLarge platesDigital displayCons:Doesn't get as hot as a professional flat ironDoesn't close as tightly as I would likeThis flat iron doesn't work nearly as well as my Solia, but considering how affordable it is and it works decently well I really can't complain and most hair types really wouldn't need as hot of an iron as my hair requires to get good results.I really like the cute pink and black design and the digital display. The plates are very smooth and glide easily across the hair, which is great. My only issue is that the plates do not come together as tightly as I would like when passing it across my hair."	"Pretty Good For The Price"	"good"
"I mean, theres not much else to say. I bought them cuz they were the cheapest ones on here. They do exactly what they are meant to."	"Cheap but does the trick"	"neutral"
"I must be defective because I put 3 layers if this on my arms and felt a slight tingle/itching sensation. Granted they say contact them for instructions regarding body application but I figured it couldn't be THAT difficult or that much different from the facial instructions. I applied the tca Monday ... It's only Wednesday but my arms are just dry. I don't really think anything is going to happen and I'm kind of annoyed -_-."	"Ummm"	"bad"
"Witch Hazel is commonly used to soothe skin and it is the main component of this facial toner.  My old barber used witch hazel on the back of my neck after shaving it with electric clippers and it is commonly prescribed by hospitals for topical treatment of irritated areas.  This is the first time I have tried using it for my face and I think it works well for people with dry or irritated skin on their face.  If you have normal to oily skin on your face and do not shave, I'm not sure if applying this toner would help at all.  I didn't notice any huge difference with this facial toner, but it did feel nice and my skin looked better at least temporarily."	"Witch Hazel Plus"	"good"
"After a few months of testing the brushes out, I found that the face brushes (powder, angled & large foundation) started shedding when cleaning. The other smaller brushes have not had this problem yet.  This set has a mix of natural & synthetic brushes. Eyeshadow lovers, be warned there are no real blending brushes in this kit, although I suppose the large pencil one can blend the crease decently."	"Good starter brushes"	"neutral"
"Flimsy, raggedy, poor quality, and unbranded. Save your money and find another listing. The brushes I received only resemble the picture in the colors on the ends of the brushes (the red, green, and blue) but in no other way, and when one of the brush ends broke off in my hand before I could even get polish on it I knew that they were meant for the trash can."	"Don't bother."	"bad"
"Great conditioner. moisturizes my hair without leaving a greasy feeling.  Has a slight scent to it. Keeps my damaged hair feeling less crunchy"	"Cheap and effective"	"good"
"This is a nice cleansing wipe but I would not use them to clean off waterproof or eye makeup.  This works well as an after work out facial cleanser.  Even a 30 second exposure in the eye area did not remove most of my eyeshadow or any eyeliner.  I did not try to scrub since based on the exposure test it does not clean eye makeup well.  The cetaphil cleanser was never great at removing make up unless you added corn starch to make it a scrub and was definitely not for use in the eye area. I will not buy this again since it does not offer a lot of cleansing power."	"Just decent&#8230;"	"neutral"
"First of all, I want to mention that I purchased this from AllureBeauti so I don't know if it's the product or the seller in this case.  I've used this in the past and really liked it.  The bottles I received were not boxed, and their was a sticky substance on the caps.  The nail treatment itself was very thin and didn't seem like the product I'd used before.  I don't know if Nail Tek changed their formula, I got a bad batch, or if this was something else altogether.  I used this product for a week, and my nails just got worse.  For the record, I did not put any polish or any other treatment on top.  My nails were on the thin side before using this (which is why I bought it), but afterwards they started splitting and actually flaking off, which has never happened to me before.  I was very disappointed because I use a lot of Nail Tek products, but I'm considering staying far away from this one, unless I buy elsewhere and try it once to see if I have the same problem."	"Not happy"	"bad"
"With 2 young adult daughters in the house we have spend 1000's of $ on acne care, skin care and makeup removers.I hear all the time how their faces are broken out so I decided to purchase each of them the Clarsonic Mia 2 and Philosophy Purity made simple cleanser which I swear by.I am 51 and have excellent skin and try to encourage our girls to take good care of their skin now, while young .Of the 2 daughters 1 had some breakouts after beginning use of the Mia the other did not. I switched 1 daughter to the sensitive brushes and had her use the lower speed until her skin adapted to the new skincare regime this seemed to correct the issue of breakouts and redness.Anytime we change our skincare routines our faces will react much like mud masks draw up all impurities the Mia does similar.Since December I have not had to buy acne pads, astrigents etc and couldn't be more pleased with the results .The key when starting to use a sonic or any brush cleaning tool on our faces is to start slow with speed, sensitive with the brushes and most importantly a gentle cleanser , there is no need for a harsh cleanser when using a deep cleaning tool.I think this product is ideal for anyone ages from teen to elder as we all need to care for our skin properly.I myself use the Mia face/body sonic care system and love the results I have had mine almost 2 years and can say Clarsonic has excellent customer service , I had an issue 8 months into using mine and they immediately replaced it even paying the shipping.It is an investment, but I think if you weigh out what you spend on makeup removers , cleansers, buffing pads and masks you will see that you will pay for this with a few months especially if you have teenagers in the house, you can get by with one Mia and buy seperate sets of brush heads for cost efficiency , but I assure you they will each want their own.Overall I would reccomend this product without hesitation.I also should add we have not had to return to the dermatologist since getting the girls the Mia , another perk for this busy mom ..."	"Clairsonic Mia 2 Great Product"	"good"
"It stings like heck.  There are other, better, products made now that I buy instead with total satisfaction.  Using a lip liner pencil combined with a lip primer works best for me - not this stuff that's mostly alcohol and very drying."	"Pass on this"	"neutral"
